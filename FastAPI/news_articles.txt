Learn More Kudos to Apple (AAPL -0.98%) for making a point of being perpetually innovative. Too many companies rest on their laurels -- or aging products -- only to end up scrambling when those goods become obsolete. Not Apple, though. The world didn't know how much it needed smartwatches until Apple made them. The app store is pretty cool, too, cementing all of its hardware and customers into a robust digital ecosystem. As it stands right now, however, Apple is still mostly a smartphone company. The iPhone accounts for roughly half of its revenue, making it more than three times bigger than even its second-biggest business. It's not the end of the world. If your revenue is going to be narrowly focused, the world's most popular smartphone is certainly a solid focal point. It's worked out well for the company since the very first iPhone's debut back in 2007.  Nevertheless, there will come a time when the iPhone isn't the powerful growth engine it is now. It's not too soon to start asking what the company's got in store for that era. The graphic below says it all. Of Apple's fiscal first-quarter revenue of $117 billion, $65 billion -- or 55% -- of it came from sales of its iPhone. The next-nearest profit center is digital services, but at just under $21 billion, it's a distant second. And, know that Q1's revenue breakdown is fairly typical for the company. Data source: Apple Inc. Image by Motley Fool. So far, no big deal. As was noted, the iPhone is not only Apple's biggest breadwinner, but thus far has been its biggest growth driver for over a decade. If it works, then it works.  There are a couple of red flags now waving that suggest the iPhone's growth-driving days are numbered, though. One of these red flags is the simple fact that unit sales of the devices aren't actually growing. While the advent of COVID-19 sparked a sales surge, unit sales were waning in the four years leading into the pandemic. Also note that the pace of sales growth has cooled again since 2020's surge, according to numbers from technology market research outfit IDC, in step with the entire smartphone industry's sales slowdown since 2016. Data source: IDC. Chart by author. All figures are in millions. The other red flag comes from data still being supplied by Apple itself. Although it no longer reports official unit sales of the iPhone, it does still report total quarterly iPhone revenue. This figure is still generally coming in higher on a year-over-year basis, but its growth pace has slumped to single-digit levels since late 2021 and even turned negative for the quarter ending in December. Data source: Apple Inc. Chart by author. Revenue data is in millions of dollars. YOY = year-over-year. Now connect the dots. Revenue is merely holding steady while unit sales are falling for one overarching reason: higher selling prices. Although the dynamic hints at pricing power, with the average new iPhone now selling in the record-breaking ballpark of $1,000 apiece, even the venerable Apple may soon find the ceiling of how much consumers are truly willing to pay for a smartphone.  It hasn't mattered much yet, if at all. Apple shares continue to move higher more often than not, and the company continues to grow other profit centers, like services and wearables. It's also easing its way into virtual reality.  There's no denying, however, that Apple is still exceedingly dependent on one single product that's just not likely to maintain its historical growth pace (in terms of unit sales or revenue). It's going to need something else to offset this headwind in the foreseeable future. If it's not another product or business line, it at least needs to be a major reinvention of an existing one. It's not too soon for shareholders to start asking questions about this problematic revenue source, particularly in light of this fiscal year's projected sales and earnings contraction. Maybe there are answers out there. If they're out there, though, the company's certainly not bringing them to the forefront.  James Brumley has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Learn More AbbVie (ABBV 0.41%) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ -0.54%) did something many other stocks didn't last year. They outperformed the S&P 500 index. These pharmaceutical giants defied the bear market as investors favored the safety of healthcare. After all, even in a difficult economy, people generally still need their medications. And this means healthcare companies may hold up better than others. This year, though, AbbVie and J&J aren't off to a strong start. They've both declined. But this might be a buying opportunity. After all, these stocks offer a track record of earnings growth and dividend increases. Which makes the better buy right now? Let's find out. I've got some good news and some bad news about AbbVie. We'll start with the bad first. The company's mega-blockbuster immunology drug, Humira, recently started facing competition in the U.S. And AbbVie predicts that this will result in a 37% decline in the drug's sales this year. This is key because AbbVie brought in more than $20 billion in revenue at its peak in 2021. Now let's move on to the good news. AbbVie's two newer immunology drugs -- Rinvoq and Skyrizi -- are on their way to compensating for Humira's loss. The two already are blockbusters, generating billions in annual revenue. The company predicts that, together, they'll deliver $17.5 billion in revenue in 2025. And in 2027, they should bring in a total of more than $21 billion in revenue. That means they'll actually surpass Humira. AbbVie also has a portfolio of other blockbusters across treatment areas, from neuroscience to aesthetics. And the company has many potential products in the pipeline, too. These should drive growth over time. In fact, AbbVie is set to dominate the prescription-drug market by 2026, with a 4.2% share, according to Evaluate. Investors can count on AbbVie for dividend growth, too. It's lifted its quarterly dividend by more than 270% since its beginnings. And today, the company delivers a dividend yield of 3.79%, higher than the industry average. J&J is heading for a big transition this year, and one that could help this pharmaceutical giant grow earnings. The company plans on spinning off its consumer health business into a separate entity called Kenvue later in 2023. Consumer health owns many products we're familiar with -- like Band-Aid brand bandages and Tylenol. But this business is weighing on overall growth at J&J. The company's two other businesses -- pharmaceuticals and medtech -- reported revenue growth of more than 6% last year. That's as consumer health reported a revenue increase of 3.9% for the year. Without consumer health, J&J's growth should benefit. At the same time, J&J is investing in growth, too. It completed the acquisition of heart-pump specialist Abiomed in December. Abiomed grew profit over 18 years. J&J expects the deal to boost the revenue of its medtech business, even adding to adjusted earnings by next year. The Abiomed purchase gives J&J 12 medtech platforms with more than $1 billion in yearly sales. J&J brought in more than $94 billion in sales in 2022. And the company has more than 100 candidates in the pipeline to keep growth going -- even as it loses exclusivity later this year for blockbuster immunology drug Stelara. Like AbbVie, J&J is a top dividend stock. As a Dividend King, it's lifted its dividend for more than 50 years. Both of these stocks sound like great buys today, considering their prospects. And the price is right, too. They each trade at around 14 times forward earnings estimates. But if I could only choose one of these pharma giants to buy right now, I'd go for J&J, and here's why. J&J is heading for a positive move that should support growth -- the spinoff of the consumer health business. And it's right around the corner. Meanwhile, AbbVie may face some pressure this year as Humira sales fall. Blockbusters do eventually lose patent protection, but considering the number of sales Humira generates, the loss is pretty big. Yes, other drugs will take over and boost growth over the long term. But AbbVie shares may stagnate a bit during this transition. All of this means, while both stocks are solid long-term buys, J&J may be the one to scoop up first.

Learn More Blue chip stocks can be ideal investments to buy and hold for decades. However, even these types of stocks haven't been immune to the current bear market. A couple of stocks that have been falling recently and that are near multi-year lows are Johnson & Johnson (JNJ -0.54%) and Home Depot (HD 0.49%). If you have enough in savings and can afford to invest $5,000, here's why you should consider buying shares of one or even both of these stocks. Over the past 12 months, Johnson & Johnson's stock has fallen 13%. However, historically, this has been a relatively safe investment to own, as in 10 years its stock value has increased by around 90%. The healthcare company has also increased its dividend for an impressive 60 straight years, earning it the title of Dividend King. Few companies can offer investors that kind of stability.  However, Johnson & Johnson has faced many legal issues. One of its most daunting is the one surrounding its talc baby powder products, which plaintiffs allege caused them to develop cancer. It could cost the company billions, and whether it's in the single digits or tens of billions depends on how many of the nearly 40,000 claims prove to be successful. Investors are feeling bearish on the company. A judge in an appeals court recently dismissed the idea of Johnson & Johnson dumping its lawsuits into a subsidiary, LTL Management LLC, and putting it into bankruptcy for the purpose of capping those claims. The battle isn't over, however, as Johnson & Johnson is taking the case to the U.S. Supreme Court.  The legal costs that could weigh on the company if Johnson & Johnson isn't successful are likely a key reason why the stock is down right now. JP Morgan analyst Chris Schott estimates the talc-related liabilities could total $9 billion. But while the situation is serious for the company, its strong financial position should enable Johnson & Johnson to be able to handle the costs relating to the lawsuits. As of the end of 2022, it had over $23 billion in cash and investments. Plus, it generated more than $17 billion in free cash last year, which was less than the nearly $20 billion it banked the year before.  Court cases can take years to drag out, and that would give Johnson & Johnson the ability to spread out the potential financial burden from these lawsuits -- assuming that its strategy to limit the cases by way of bankrupting LTL Management LLC proves to be unsuccessful. There is some risk here, but it could be a calculated one worth taking. Johnson & Johnson's stock hasn't been this low since late 2020. And with the company spinning off its consumer health business this year and focusing on medical devices and pharmaceuticals, it may become a faster-growing operation, making it a better buy in the long run. Although it's not an entirely risk-free investment, Johnson & Johnson can make for a good contrarian buy right now. At 3%, its dividend yield is also well above the S&P 500 average of 1.7%. On a $5,000 investment, that can mean $150 in dividend income for your portfolio each year -- and more if the dividend increases. Plus, with the stock at a low, there's the potential for you to also net a good return just from buying and holding shares of Johnson & Johnson. Another normally safe dividend stock that hasn't been doing well over the past 12 months is Home Depot. It too can be a great place to invest $5,000, as the home improvement retailer's shares are down around 9%, faring only a bit better than Johnson & Johnson. The company benefited from a surge in consumer spending during the early stages of the pandemic, but that has since come to a grinding halt. In its fourth-quarter results, for the period ending Jan. 29, its sales totaled $35.8 billion and were flat from the prior-year period. The company missed expectations, and its guidance for the new fiscal year also implies no growth. It's easy to see why investors may be bearish on the business. But in the long run, this can still be an excellent buy, as home repair is a necessary expense for consumers. Renovations are more discretionary, but there could be much stronger demand in the future once economic conditions improve. Despite inflation and people tightening up on spending, Home Depot has still been performing well. In the trailing 12 months, the company netted a solid profit margin of 11% and generated $11.5 billion in free cash flow.  Buying shares of Home Depot can be a great move today. It's trading not just around its 52-week low, but also its two-year low. And with a dividend yield of just under 3%, it's also a great income-generating investment to own. David Jagielski has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Home Depot. The Motley Fool recommends Johnson & Johnson.

Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Although most of us think of banks that take deposits when we think of banking, there are other types of banks in the investing world. Merchant banks are banks that help medium-sized businesses with a range of financial services. When a medium-sized business needs help with international transactions or financing, they have to go to a bank that’s made for them. They’re too big to borrow from a retail bank since they’re likely to need millions of dollars -- but they’re not big enough yet to engage with an investment bank for complex transactions like initial public offerings (IPOs). This is where the merchant bank comes in. These banks have been around for hundreds of years. They began as a way for merchants to loan money to other businesses but have evolved into banks that offer specific international financing and underwriting services to multinational companies. Handling international transactions is a service they offer; so is helping a company navigate financing from multiple sources, known as loan syndication. Some also help connect companies to various types of private equity.   Merchant banks are frequently confused with investment banks, but the two are very different. Investment banks are meant for huge transactions like IPOs, or other very large public and private share offerings. Their clients typically include institutional investors, governments, and huge multinational corporations. They can also assist with mergers and acquisitions, another service that large public companies need. Merchant banks, on the other hand, bridge the gap between retail bank business services for small businesses and investment banks. They typically service high-net-worth individuals or mid-level businesses with an international presence. They can handle a multitude of international monetary transactions and help companies connect to outside financing, either through bank lenders or private equity firms. They do not assist with mergers or acquisitions.  There are several services that a merchant bank can provide for its customers, including:  If you've ever wondered how banks make their money, read on. Investment banking refers to certain services that can be performed by financial institutions. Banks may seem complicated, but the way they make money is pretty straightforward. Bank collapses can have devastating effects on economies, causing a ripple effect of financial and social consequences.  Most of the world’s biggest merchant banks are also involved in other types of banking. These include banks like JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM  -0.19%), Goldman Sachs (GS  0.87%), Citigroup (C  -0.75%), Morgan Stanley (MS  0.76%), Deutsche Bank (DB  -0.18%), and Credit Suisse (CS  -0.13%). Often, these banks offer merchant banking as a separate branch of the company, potentially under different branding, to avoid conflicts of interest. This helps to prevent the mixing of services to businesses and preserves the distinctions between the commercial, merchant, and investment banking parts of the bank since this is a highly regulated sector. Many merchant banks are small, boutique operations that keep a very low profile. You may never hear about merchant banks unless you work for or own a company that uses them frequently. For example, Berenberg Bank is the oldest merchant bank still in existence, founded in 1540 and headquartered in Hamburg, Germany.

AAPL (2023-03-30 20:10:04): Sign up for MarketBeat All Access to gain access to MarketBeat's full suite of research tools:  Investors could do worse than buying stocks owned by Warren Buffett. Some of the most famous Warren Buffett stocks include Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO) and Bank of America Co. (NYSE: BAC). But the one stock that may be the best for investors to own is Buffett's holding company, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE: BRK.B).  By investing in BRK.B stock, investors can enjoy many benefits of Buffett's stock-picking acumen. The company's holdings total over $334 billion and include the names mentioned above, along with companies like Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) and American Express Company (NYSE: AXP). Earlier this year, American Express chief executive officer (CEO) Stephen Squeri remarked that having Berkshire Hathaway own the company's stock was "sort of like a Good Housekeeping seal of approval."  However, many investors don't make the connection between the companies that are part of the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio and the company's business model. But in a financial world full of unforced errors regarding interest rate risks, it's worth looking at the structure of Berkshire Hathaway.  Berkshire Hathaway is a conglomerate that reaches many sectors, including retail and energy. But the key driver of the company's overall performance is its insurance business. The purchase of the National Indemnity Company was Buffett's first acquisition when he took over Berkshire.  This gives Berkshire Hathaway access to the float from insurance premiums, which serves as a cash cow for the company. "Float" is the money the company receives from its policyholders and can hold onto and invest until it needs to pay claims.  In his most recent letter to shareholders, Buffett noted that this float "has increased 8,000-fold through acquisitions, operations and innovations." Unlike bank deposits, Berkshire doesn't have to worry about insurance clients digitally withdrawing their funds en masse. That means the company's equity portfolio, which was about $335 billion last year, is secure.  And even inside that low-risk model, Berkshire still has a capital surplus of nearly $300 billion in its insurance units. Once again, unlike the banks, Berkshire holds cash — mostly in short-term Treasury bills and stocks, not bonds. As Treasury bills will reprice in yield, Berkshire will benefit from more interest income, already at $1.7 billion last year, a gain of 186%.  Berkshire Hathaway's operating income should rise 11% this year to about $34 billion after taxes. The stock is trading for about 20 times projected 2023 earnings, below its historical average of 21 times, and for about 1.4 times its year-end 2022 book value, in line with the five-year average.  As Buffett pointed out in the company's annual letter to shareholders, 2022 was a good year by many measures. The company generated operating earnings after taxes of $30.8 billion. And at the end of the year, Berkshire Hathaway had nearly $129 billion in available cash. One of Buffett's fundamental investing precepts is to be greedy when others are fearful. That kind of cash balance gives Buffett all types of ammunition if he decides to make some aggressive bets.  Before you consider Berkshire Hathaway, you'll want to hear this.

Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -0.54%) is an iconic global healthcare company. It was originally formed in 1866 when three brothers (Robert, Edward, and James Johnson) founded the company to focus on producing bandages and baby products. It has since grown into one of the largest and most well-regarded healthcare companies in the world. Johnson & Johnson has three main concentrations: In 2021, Johnson & Johnson unveiled a plan to spin off its consumer products division to focus on pharmaceuticals and medical technology. The company expects to complete the Kenvue spin-off to shareholders in November 2023. Here's a step-by-step on how to buy shares of Johnson & Johnson and some factors to consider before investing in the healthcare stock.

Before buying shares of Johnson & Johnson, you need to determine whether the company's stock is a good investment. Here are some reasons why you might want to consider buying shares of Johnson & Johnson: On the other hand, here are some factors to consider that might make you decide not to buy shares. Healthcare is a universal need. Companies in this broad-based sector can produce healthy returns. No matter what the economy, we always need these products. When people have a little extra cash, they indulge in offerings from these companies. Good research can help investors find the best companies to invest in. Profit growth helps power stock price appreciation over the longer term. It's an ideal area for beginning investors to focus on before buying shares of a company. Johnson & Johnson is a very profitable company. The healthcare giant produced $27 billion of adjusted earnings in 2022, a 3.2% increase from 2021. The company has an excellent long-term record of increasing its revenue, income, and shareholder value. Johnson & Johnson has a distinguished track record of paying dividends. In 2022, the healthcare giant delivered its 60th consecutive year of increasing its dividend. That puts it in the elite group of Dividend Kings, companies that have increased their dividend payments for 50 or more years. Instead of actively buying shares of Johnson & Johnson directly, you can passively invest in the healthcare company through a fund holding its shares. Johnson & Johnson is one of the largest traded companies by market capitalization. It's a widely held stock. Johnson & Johnson is in several stock market indexes, including the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 Index. As a result, index funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that benchmark their returns against those indexes hold Johnson & Johnson stock. According to EFT. Com, 341 ETFs held 238.5 million shares of Johnson & Johnson as of early 2023. The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NASDAQ:SPY) owned the most shares at 28.1 million. However, Johnson & Johnson only had a 1.2% portfolio weight in the ETF. Investors wanting an ETF with greater exposure to Johnson & Johnson could consider the iShares U.S. Pharmaceuticals ETF (IHE  0.77%). Johnson & Johnson had a 21.1% portfolio weighting in the ETF. It's a better option for investors seeking to invest passively in Johnson & Johnson without directly buying shares. As of early 2023, Johnson & Johnson had not announced an upcoming stock split. However, the company has completed several stock splits over the years. He's a snapshot of the JNJ stock split history: Although Johnson & Johnson has no upcoming stock split, the company plans to spin off its consumer business (Kenvue) in November 2023. When that happens, investors will receive shares of Kenvue in addition to their Johnson & Johnson stock. Johnson & Johnson is a global healthcare giant. It should benefit from the continued growth in healthcare spending in the coming years. That could enable the company to continue growing its earnings and dividend, which should drive the share prices higher over the long term. It could be a good stock to buy for people seeking steady growth from the healthcare sector.

Research and development activities, otherwise known as R&D, are centered on discovering and creating new products or services for a company. Most companies have R&D expenses, but technology and pharmaceutical companies tend to spend especially large amounts to stay ahead of the competition. A major advantage of R&D expenses is their ability to be used to reduce taxes. If you want to invest in high-growth companies, you'll need to understand how R&D works, the common types of R&D, and its importance to investors. Research and development expenses are incurred by governments and corporations. Corporations typically invest the funds in a more focused way with a targeted return on investment (ROI); governments create grants and other ways for third parties to receive taxpayer funds for R&D. We'll focus more on the corporate side of things. R&D is necessarily a long-term, focused expense. The types of products and services created in R&D departments often take years to develop. Corporations have to balance the long time frame in research and development with the prospects of generating a positive ROI from the expenditure. Measuring return on investment is common for capital expenditures, such as buying new equipment or building a new office, but it is less common for operating expenses. With capital expenditures, the calculation is easy: You figure out how much cash flow you'll generate from the new investment and make sure the cash outflow is offset by the new profits. With R&D, it's not as clear since it's almost certain that some or most of the funds you invest will be worthless. To paraphrase Thomas Edison, you don't fail, you just find thousands of things that don't work. Alphabet's (GOOGL  0.11%) 20% rule is good example of using R&D to maximize profits. All Google employees are allowed to work on personal projects one day a week. Products as diverse as Google News, Wear OS, and Gmail came from Alphabet's 20% rule. The R&D expense was obviously profitable for the company, but there was no way for Alphabet to determine the potential returns. A good rule of thumb for corporations is the use of return on research capital, which is calculated by dividing the previous year's R&D by the current year's gross profit. The formula isn't perfect, but it's a widely accepted method of calculating ROI for R&D. Research and development trickles down into everyday products through several different models. Let's go over the most popular. Large corporations have departments staffed with engineers and industrial scientists who do research on various levels of the R&D process to develop new products and improve existing ones. The most common example is pharmaceutical companies developing and testing new drugs. While large corporations may dedicate a department to R&D, some start-ups dedicate the whole company to R&D, such as companies with no revenue that spend all their money and time on developing self-driving cars, new cancer drugs, or even a better razor. R&D-focused start-ups often work with incubators or accelerators. Both incubators and accelerators are run by venture capital firms, and they work with start-ups at different stages of the business. Typically, incubators work with start-ups that are mostly still an idea. They help the company develop the idea, plan a business model, and create a product. Accelerators work with start-ups that have an established product and help them bring the product to market and scale the business. The end game for both types is often a merger with a bigger company. The problem with research and development at a big corporation is that it's R&D at a big corporation. It's hard to be innovative when you work a 9-to-5 job, report to a middle manager, and get an annual 2% cost-of-living raise. So, when big corporate R&D departments aren't cutting it, the big corporation will often look to acquire a small, innovative company. This process is more common than you'd think. The Android OS was originally developed by a start-up that Google acquired to get into mobile. Microsoft (MSFT  -0.12%) acquired Hotmail and 86-DOS. eBay (EBAY  -0.62%) acquired Paypal (PYPL  0.81%) (and then spun it off). Google acquired YouTube. Disney (DIS  1.53%) acquired Pixar, ABC, ESPN, and Lucasfilm. In addition to being a last resort for bigger companies that haven't been able to develop their own products, mergers and acquisitions offer a much clearer ROI proposition. The corporation knows the exact amount it must spend to acquire the company and then can determine the cash flows from the acquisition once it's complete. R&D is a vital expense for companies to continue growing and fending off competitors. Here are a few key reasons for a company to keep healthy R&D expenses going: Developing strong competitive advantages is key to long-term profitability. This means constantly developing newer and better products that cost less to produce. Some of the biggest R&D spenders in the U.S. are companies such as Amazon (AMZN  3.03%), Apple (AAPL  -0.98%), and Alphabet, which spend billions on R&D each year. Let's look at Amazon and now-defunct Borders, both once flourishing general interest bookstores and almost direct competitors. Consider what the two bookstores look like now for someone who invested in them 25 years ago. Amazon, which began life as an online bookstore, now houses a multibillion-dollar cloud services business; has profitable funnels to its Prime program using tablets, e-readers, original TV series and movies, digital media players and eBook subscription services; and voice-activated products like Alexa that wouldn't have existed if it hadn't made investments in R&D over the past two decades. Borders, meanwhile, has been out of business for a decade. A big reason that Amazon still exists and Borders doesn't is because Amazon was able to leverage its R&D program. R&D isn't only focused on developing new products. There is also substantial investment that goes into figuring out better ways to produce existing products. The faster and cheaper you can churn out widgets, the more money you'll make from each one -- and the less you can eventually charge for them, earning a competitive advantage. Every product has a life cycle. While some stay in the growth phase longer than others, there will eventually be an end to outsized profits. This is especially true for the pharmaceutical industry. Companies spend billions developing and improving drugs, and then they have a finite life cycle until the recipe is made available to everyone else to reproduce. If pharma companies weren't constantly investing in R&D, they would eventually run out of revenue sources. In addition to writing off R&D expenses on the income statement, many jurisdictions offer tax benefits for engaging in specific types of R&D. Good research can help investors find the best companies to invest in. The goal of investing is making your money grow. This kind of interest is a key tool. Bonds are often considered a "safe" investment, but are they right for you? When a stock or index falls, it can be a buying opportunity using this strategy. R&D can be the lifeblood of a technology business. There is no better way to stay ahead of peers and create new opportunities for growth than research and development. If you're learning about investing in high-growth companies, keep an eye on the R&D line item. Make sure the company is investing enough and generating a satisfactory return on its investment.

Learn More What does big pharma Johnson & Johnson (JNJ -0.54%) have in common with biotech Moderna (MRNA -0.20%)? Well, both companies have been working to conquer a common respiratory virus. They've both approached the finish line with vaccine candidates for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Last week, however, Johnson & Johnson said it would discontinue its adult RSV program. And that means one less potential competitor for Moderna, as the biotech aims to file for regulatory approval in the first half of this year. Could the J&J news eventually translate into billions of dollars for Moderna? Let's find out. J&J isn't bowing out due to a problem with its candidate's performance. Instead, this is happening as part of the company's routine portfolio review -- to keep the focus on "medicines with the greatest potential benefit to patients." RSV is definitely an area of need. Today, there is no approved vaccine to prevent the illness in older adults. And this population is particularly at risk of severe infection: Between 60,000 and 160,000 older Americans require hospitalization every year due to RSV, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But this situation may quickly change. GSK (GSK 0.69%) and Pfizer (PFE 0.90%) have already applied for approval of their investigational RSV vaccines. A U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advisory committee voted unanimously for the efficacy of the GSK candidate, and 7 to 4 in favor of Pfizer's efficacy. The committee also supported the safety of each candidate. The FDA is set to make a decision on both potential products in May. It's impossible to predict what that decision will be with complete accuracy. However, considering the data and the committee votes, there's reason to be optimistic about the GSK and Pfizer candidates. So, let's imagine the FDA gives both the nod. Then let's say Moderna submits its candidate according to plan -- and wins approval later this year, or at the start of 2024. Could Moderna gain some of the extra market share that might have gone to J&J? In this scenario, GSK and Pfizer clearly will have the first-to-market advantage. It's difficult to compare data across the three companies' clinical trials; each trial is designed differently, and the participants' health profiles aren't identical. Still, Moderna may have a slight efficacy advantage. Moderna's vaccine showed overall efficacy of 83.7%. GSK's reached 82.6% and Pfizer's came in weaker at 66.7% overall. These numbers may not greatly affect vaccine sales right away. If anything, Moderna may have to work a little harder than its peers when it launches, if it enters the market several months later. That said, Moderna's strong efficacy numbers could make its product a top choice for the highest-risk individuals, so the biotech could have a shot at some of the market share that would have gone to J&J. Moderna's product also could appeal to healthcare providers, since the company has built a solid reputation in the world of respiratory-virus vaccines -- thanks to its coronavirus vaccine. And Moderna is investing in building out its infrastructure. So it should be in great shape to launch its vaccine when the time comes. Finally, in a three-company market, Moderna clearly could carve out plenty of market share -- which should translate into blockbuster revenue. Moderna predicts the older-adult RSV market represents an opportunity of more than $10 billion. J&J's exit from the RSV market leaves Moderna even more room to grow in a billion-dollar market. So this is good news for the company -- and for investors. This may not lift the stock right away; Moderna's revenue is set to fall this year as we move toward a post-pandemic world. Coronavirus vaccine demand is on the decline. But this is a year of transition. Next year -- if Moderna wins a regulatory nod for its RSV candidate -- could be the start of a new era of growth. And investors who hold onto Moderna for the long term may reap the rewards. Adria Cimino has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Pfizer.

Learn More When stock market turbulence picks up, smart investors often turn to dividend stocks. Companies that regularly pay a dividend to their shareholders tend to be recurringly profitable and, in most instances, time-tested. What's more, income stocks have a history of crushing their non-paying peers. Based on a study released in 2013 from a division of JPMorgan Chase, companies that initiated and grew their payouts between 1972 and 2012 generated an annualized return of 9.5%. That was almost 500% better than the 1.6% annualized return companies that didn't offer a payout achieved between 1972 and 2012. This outperformance for dividend stocks isn't lost on Wall Street. Based on the high-water price targets issued by select analysts, Wall Street expects the following three high-yield dividend stocks to return up to 140% for their shareholders. The Mustang Mach-E is one of 30 EV models Ford is expected to have launched globally through mid-decade. Image source: Ford. The first high-octane income stock at least one Wall Street analyst believes has abundant upside is legacy auto stock Ford Motor Company (F -0.51%). Even after lowering his firm's price target on Ford following its fourth-quarter earnings release, Bank of America's John Murphy foresees Ford shares rising to $21.  This would represent 71% upside from where shares ended on March 30. Ford has endured its share of missteps over the past year. Rapidly rising costs have narrowed its margins, while supply chain challenges (some by its own doing) have reduced the company's production capacity. CEO Jim Farley has been crystal clear with his shareholder base that addressing supply chain issues is Ford's primary focus. But what really has Wall Street excited is what Ford is doing with regard to electrifying its fleet of vehicles. While internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles remain Ford's core profit-driver, the company is investing $50 billion to develop electric vehicles (EVs), autonomous vehicles, and batteries through 2026. The goal for Ford is to be producing more than 2 million EVs annually by the end of 2026, as well as to introduce 30 new EV models globally through mid-decade.  The popular Mustang Mach-E is one of the 30 EV models that's put Ford on the cutting edge of automotive innovation. Although EVs represent a sustained double-digit growth opportunity for Ford, it's important for investors not to overlook the role ICE vehicles continue to play. In particular, the company's F-Series pickup has been America's top-selling truck for the past 46 years, and the best-selling vehicle, period, over the last 41 years.  Since bigger vehicles tend to generate juicier margins, I can't overstate how important the success of Ford's F-Series pickup is to its bottom line. Currently valued at less than 8 times Wall Street's consensus earnings for 2023 and 2024, Ford stock appears reasonably cheap. But considering it's yet to prove to investors that's it overcome its supply chain challenges, don't expect to see a $21 share price this year. A second high-yield dividend stock one analyst on Wall Street expects to soar is cannabis-focused real estate investment trust (REIT) Innovative Industrial Properties (IIPR 0.07%). IIP, as the company is more commonly known, sports a nearly 10% yield and, according to BTIG analyst Thomas Catherwood, is capable of reaching $179 per share.  If this price target proves accurate, Catherwood's call would imply 140% upside. When the curtain closed on 2022, Innovative Industrial Properties owned 110 medical marijuana cultivating and processing facilities spanning approximately 8.7 million square feet in 19 legalized states. The remaining weighted-average lease length on these properties was a cool 15.3 years. In other words, the advantage of REITs is intended to be the predictability of their operating cash flow. Perhaps the best aspect of IIP's operating model is that 100% of its leases are triple net (also known as "NNN").  An NNN lease requires the tenant to cover all property expenses, including utilities, maintenance, property tax, and insurance. While this style of lease results in lower rental payments, the advantage is that it removes unexpected costs from the equation. Once again, we're talking about highly predictable cash flow with IIP. Another interesting quirk about Innovative Industrial Properties is that it's actually benefiting from Congress's inability to pass cannabis banking reform. As long as marijuana remains illegal, access to basic banking services is dicey, at best, for multi-state operators (MSOs). IIP has filled this void by purchasing facilities from MSOs for cash and immediately leasing them back to the seller. These sale-leaseback agreements net IIP long-term tenants while providing needed cash to MSOs. The one hurdle to BTIG's lofty price target is going to be Innovative Industrial Properties' ability to deal with rental delinquencies. After collecting all of its rents on-time in previous years, only 92% of rents were on-time in February 2023. While IIP appears to be successfully working through its near-term struggles with its delinquent tenants, a 140% increase in 2023 probably isn't in the cards until its on-time rent-collection rate is back at, or very near, 100%. Image source: Getty Images. The third high-yield dividend stock with significant upside potential, per one Wall Street analyst, is pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA -0.28%). According to analyst Charles Ryhee of Cowen, Walgreens can hit $54 per share, which would represent delectable upside of 56% for its shareholders. Typically, healthcare stocks are relatively impervious to recessions and wild stock market gyrations. Because we have no say when we become ill, there's constant demand for healthcare services, pharmaceuticals, and devices. But Walgreens' shareholders learned a tough lesson during the COVID-19 pandemic. Since Walgreens Boots Alliance brings in the lion's share of its revenue from its brick-and-mortar stores, initial lockdowns proved painful to its top and bottom line. Walgreens is still digging its way out after a couple of rough years. The good news is Walgreens Boots Alliance is also multiple years into a turnaround plan that focuses on boosting its organic growth rate and attracting repeat customers. The most-prominent aspect of this plan involves the promotion of healthcare services. Walgreens has become a core investor in VillageMD. The two have opened 210 full-service health clinics co-located in Walgreens' stores.  Having physician-staffed clinics is a differentiator that should bring patients back into its stores with regularity. As I've previously pointed out, Walgreens hasn't been shy about putting money to work in various digitization initiatives. The pandemic was a wake-up call for management that the company needed to expand its online offerings and provide a more-convenient shopping experience. Even with a large brick-and-mortar presence, rising digital sales and a more-efficient supply chain have made these digitization investments well worth it. With Walgreens Boots Alliance shares valued at an inexpensive 7 times Wall Street's consensus earnings for fiscal 2024, it looks to have a good shot at reaching $54 at some point in the future.

Learn More Investors can be forgiven if they're feeling shaken up after 2022. The Nasdaq 100 index plunged 33% which was its worst performance since the 2008 global financial crisis.  But think about that for a second -- the stock market basically had over a decade of clear sailing. Sure, there were a couple of minor bumps along the way, but it's proof that taking a longer-term view can smooth out the noise and increase the odds investors will generate a positive return.  With that in mind, let's explore three stocks growing quickly enough right now to deliver a fivefold return over the next 10 years. That means any one of them alone -- or a combination of all three -- could turn a $200,000 investment into $1 million.  Have you ever used a sports betting platform to place a bet during a live game? Or do you often walk into a Walmart store and find exactly what you're looking for, every time? Delivering those convenient experiences takes a monumental technological effort behind the scenes, and Confluent (CFLT 3.81%) is the company powering it.  It's a leading provider of data streaming technology, an opportunity Confluent values at $60 billion today. By 2025, the International Data Corporation thinks 90% of the 1,000 largest companies in the world will be using it -- so it's worth paying attention. The technology allows businesses to draw real-time insights from the data they generate through their cloud-based operations. For sportsbooks, data streaming is used to facilitate live betting; when an event occurs during a match, odds must be recalculated and pushed to the customer in a matter of seconds, several times per game. In Walmart's case, the technology is used for inventory management. It links every physical store and every online sales channel so whenever a product is sold, it's quickly replenished before it runs out of stock. At the end of 2022, Confluent had 4,530 customers, including 991 spending at least $100,000 on its platform every year.  Confluent stock trades at a price to sales (P/S) ratio of 11.7 right now, based on $585.9 million in 2022 revenue and the company's current valuation of $6.9 billion. Assuming that P/S ratio remains constant, Confluent will have to grow its revenue by 17.5% each year between now and 2033 for its stock to soar fivefold and help turn $200,000 into $1 million.  Considering it has grown at a compound annual rate of 73% since 2018, when it generated $65.1 million in revenue, the company could slow down significantly and still meet the necessary growth rate.  Small businesses have enough on their plate without having to worry about administrative work, especially when it comes to tracking incoming and outgoing invoices and ensuring payments are up to date on both ends. Alas, it's a critical part of managing any successful enterprise, and that's why small to midsize businesses are flocking to Bill.com (BILL 3.56%). It streamlines the accounts payable and accounts receivable workflows through the use of cloud technology. For example, operators can receive invoices, or upload them, directly to a digital inbox, and thanks to integrations with third-party platforms, they can pay those bills with one click and have the transaction automatically logged in their bookkeeping system. No more messy paper trails; no more missed payments. Bill.com earns most of its revenue by taking a small percentage of each transaction facilitated by its platforms, and it's currently processing payments at an annualized rate of $250 billion. But for perspective, it's targeting a market worth $125 trillion, so it has barely scratched the surface of its opportunity.  Over the past four years, the company has grown its revenue at a remarkable compound annual rate of 77%, from $64 million in fiscal 2018 to $641 million in fiscal 2022, which ended last June 30. It's unlikely to keep growing at that blistering pace, but remember, it has to grow its revenue by only 17.5% per year between now and 2033 for its stock to achieve a fivefold return, assuming its current P/S ratio remains constant. Moreover, Bill.com stock is down 75% from its all-time high amid the broader sell-off in the tech sector. If it simply recovers those losses, it will generate three-quarters of the gain it needs to turn $200,000 into $1 million. According to an estimate by Grand View Research, the cloud computing industry could be worth upwards of $1.5 trillion per year by the end of the current decade. That's a big opportunity for one small provider of cloud services, DigitalOcean (DOCN 3.53%), which has a market capitalization of just $3.8 billion today.  The company offers a portfolio of solutions targeting businesses with less than 500 employees, including startups, to help them host websites, develop software, store data, and even stream video. DigitalOcean is competing with giants in the cloud industry, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure, which have the support of their trillion-dollar parent companies.  But AWS and Azure make most of their money from larger enterprise customers; it's not economical for them to offer the same level of personalized service, support, and affordable pricing structures to small businesses the way DigitalOcean can. DigitalOcean's customers, for example, spend an average of just $80.27 per month. Nonetheless, it's a lucrative segment of the cloud market because it's expected to be worth $98 billion this year, and it could double to $198 billion by 2026.  DigitalOcean generated $576 million in revenue in 2022, representing a compound annual growth rate of 29% since 2018, when it brought in $203 million. While it's not expanding quite as quickly as Confluent or Bill.com, it's still comfortably above the 17.5% annual growth rate necessary to turn $200,000 into $1 million by 2033, assuming its P/S ratio remains constant.  Plus, it has barely captured a fraction of its addressable market, so there's scope for its growth to accelerate. There was evidence of that in 2022, when its revenue growth came in at 34%, which was above its four-year average.  John Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Learn More Shares of industrial and materials stocks were getting hammered on Tuesday, with sector leaders Caterpillar (CAT -0.36%), Johnson Controls (JCI 0.03%), and Steel Dynamics (STLD -1.26%) all falling hard, down 5%, 4.5%, and 7.8%, respectively, as of 1:30 p.m. ET. The across-the-board sell-off portends some sort of macroeconomic or market-based fear, and likely one that would increase the odds of a recession. All three companies are economically sensitive, with Caterpillar and Johnson Controls highly exposed to the level of construction spending, while Steel Dynamics also exposed to both construction and auto sales. So, all three would likely suffer in a recession brought about by the Federal Reserve's rapid interest rate increases. Today, two data points indicated potentially difficult times ahead in the sector: a lower-than-expected Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) for February, as well as a massive decline in apartment building sales, as reported by CoStar Group. Image source: Getty Images. But is the drop an overreaction? Today, the February JOLTS report came out, and the number of job openings came in far below expectations. February reported 9.93 million job openings, down 632,000 from January, and well below the 10.4 million estimate. That was also the first time JOLTS had fallen below 10 million since May 2021 -- shortly after COVID vaccines had been widely distributed. In addition, even the "hot" January numbers were revised down.  The big miss suggests the economy may be cooling rather quickly. And keep in mind that this is data for February, which was over a month ago. That's before the regional banking crisis hit, and before the latest hike in the federal funds rate, which could even further slow down the economy. In addition, real estate data provider CoStar released its first-quarter report on the state of apartment building sales today. The report showed a massive 74% decline in apartment building sales -- the largest drop since the 77% decline in the first quarter of 2009, just as the Great Recession was kicking in. Real estate prices are generally falling, while the costs of lending have greatly increased, making purchasing an apartment building less attractive for investors. And while there is a lot of supply coming on to the market this year, a cool real estate market has the potential to mute building activity.  Obviously, lower building activity would limit sales and usage of Caterpillar's construction machines, as well as Johnson Controls' heating, air conditioning, ventilation, refrigeration, and security systems, along with Steel Dynamics' construction-related steel products. Steel Dynamics may be especially sensitive to the economy, as it is dependent on the price of steel, which fluctuates more than prices for downstream machinery made by Caterpillar and Johnson Controls. Still, here's why this sell-off could be an overreaction, and therefore an opportunity.  The industrials and commodities segments are in an interesting place right now, stuck in between two crosscurrents. On one hand, the Fed is trying to cool inflation through its rapid interest rate increases, which have the potential to knock the economy into a recession. That would obviously be bad for these economically sensitive stocks.  On the other hand, these three companies should also benefit from the government's effort to "reshore" U.S. manufacturing, as well as various infrastructure bills passed over the past two years. These include the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law passed in late 2021, along with the CHIPS Act and Inflation Reduction Act passed in mid-2022. All three of those laws designate money for construction of industrial, manufacturing, broadband, and clean energy infrastructure in the U.S., and money from all three laws should begin to come through this year while ramping up over the next five years or so. And even within today's "weak" JOLTS numbers, while overall openings declined, they are still relatively high on a historical basis, with 1.7 openings per every employed person. Breaking down the JOLTS numbers by segment, the number of construction job openings actually increased in February, with the declines seen in other sectors, such as business and professional services.     Therefore, it's possible construction activity may not fall off as hard as some may fear. Furthermore, if we do get a near-term recession and building slowdown, construction activity could pick up again after not too much time as money from the various stimulus bills kicks in. Therefore, should these industrial and commodity stocks sell off further, they may be stocks to put on your buy list to play a strong domestic recovery.

The Fortune 100 are the top 100 companies within the Fortune 500, an annual list published by Fortune magazine of the 500 largest U.S. companies. The magazine ranks companies in the Fortune 500 by reported revenue. The list includes public and private companies incorporated and operating in the U.S. and filing financial statements with the government. The Fortune 100 is not an official list within the Fortune 500 but a subset of the group. It differs from Fortune's 100 Best Companies to Work For and Fortune's 100 Fastest-Growing Companies. The Fortune 100 are the 100 largest companies in the U.S. ranked by revenue. They’re an unofficial subgroup of the Fortune 500 list published each year by Fortune magazine. Fortune has been posting its list of the 500 largest companies in the U.S. ranked by revenue since 1955. The magazine uses revenue reported by companies to a government agency, such as the 10-K annual report that publicly traded companies file with the SEC. Fortune published its latest Fortune 500 list in May 2022, ranking companies by revenue for the 2021 fiscal year. The top 100 companies on that list were: The top 100 companies in the Fortune 500 include publicly traded companies and privately held businesses. The list also features companies from almost all sectors of the economy. The Fortune 500 comprise a significant percentage of the U.S. economy. In 2022, the group generated $16.1 trillion in revenue, representing about two-thirds of the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP). The Fortune 100 represent the top 100 revenue generators in the U.S. economy, making them the country’s most important economic drivers. The Fortune 100 is a prestigious list. Many companies will highlight their ranking in the Fortune 100 to showcase their size and importance to the economy. Others will use the list to show their success in securing high-profile clients. For example, a smaller company might highlight that a large percentage of the Fortune 100 utilizes its solutions or that it recently signed a contract with a company on the Fortune 100. As an important list of large companies ranked by revenue, the Fortune 100 can help investors see which companies generated the most revenue in the previous fiscal year compared to other companies in their sector and in different industries. Investors can also compare the current year's list to prior years to see which companies are rising or declining. However, the list has its shortcomings. Investors value revenue growth and earnings growth over having lots of revenue. The largest publicly traded companies by market cap differ (materially in some cases) from their ranking on the Fortune 100 list. Here's how the top 10 companies in the S&P 500 Index compare to their order in the Fortune 100: As the table shows, one of the 10 biggest companies by market cap (Nvidia) didn't produce enough revenue in 2021 to rank in the Fortune 100, while others rank much lower on the Fortune 100 than their weighting in the S&P 500. This highly variable metric is the value of all the company's shares. Which companies are blue chip stocks? We've got the list. Greed is not good when it comes to the stock market. Learn what this old expression really means. Looking at this metric can put both valuation and risk into context. The Fortune 100 list can change from year to year. Companies move up the Fortune 100 list as their revenue grows or drop down in the ranking (or off the list) as it declines or others increase their revenue faster, so the Fortune 100 list can see dramatic changes over the years. For example, a decade ago, the top 10 companies on Fortune's list were: The list featured three oil and two automotive companies in the top 10, with only one technology company and none from the healthcare sector. Fast-forward a decade, and the top 10 from 2022 featured four healthcare and three technology companies (if you count Amazon as tech). The change shows the tremendous revenue growth of healthcare and technology companies over the past 10 years and the decline in autos and oil as the world shifts to cleaner alternatives. Investors can glean some important insights by watching how the list changes over the years. Focusing on companies rising up the list (and avoiding declining ones) could help boost returns since it suggests risers are increasing revenues at an above-average pace.

Learn More The pharmaceutical industry is a great place to look for dividend stocks, and AbbVie (ABBV 0.41%) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ -0.54%) are among the best. Both drugmakers generally grow their dividends at a good clip, and both are part of the highly exclusive group of Dividend Kings, having raised their payouts for more than 50 years straight. But which of these pharmaceutical giants is the better dividend stock? Let's look into both companies and decide.  AbbVie is going through a bit of a difficult period. In January, it started facing biosimilar competition in the U.S. for its blockbuster immunology medicine, Humira. The drugmaker expects its top line to decrease this year and the next as a result. But AbbVie's dividend is safe, and its prospects remain attractive. The company's lineup of medicines is vast, with several products that will help supplement Humira's sales drop gaining momentum. One of them is the migraine treatment Qulipta. There is also cancer medicine Venclexta and AbbVie's Botox franchise. But AbbVie's most important growth drivers will be Skyrizi and Rinvoq, two immunology drugs taking over many of Humira's indications. For instance, Skyrizi proved more effective than Humira at clearing skin in plaque psoriasis patients. Skyrizi and Rinvoq are expected to surpass Humira's peak annual sales by 2027 and maintain their momentum thereafter. So there is a long road of growth ahead for these medicines. Last year, AbbVie's net revenue increased by 3.3% year over year to $58.1 billion. The company's adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $13.77 increased by about 16.4% year over year. As a Dividend King, AbbVie has raised its payouts for 51 consecutive years when taking into consideration that it used to be under the banner of medical device giant Abbott Laboratories. But since it split from its former parent company in 2013, AbbVie has increased its payouts by 270%. Its current yield of 3.71% is higher than the S&P 500 average of 1.74%, and its cash payout ratio of 41.42% leaves plenty of room for further hikes. AbbVie looks strong enough to overcome the challenges to Humira and come out with a stronger company that still routinely rewards its shareholders with dividend increases. Johnson & Johnson has a diversified business. The company is a leader in the pharmaceutical industry, with a presence in oncology, immunology, neuroscience, infectious diseases, and more. But the company also boasts a prominent medical device unit that recently got even stronger with the acquisition of Abiomed, which most notably provides oxygenation support medical technology. There is another important way in which Johnson & Johnson is changing. The company is still splitting up its consumer health segment. The transaction should boost Johnson & Johnson's revenue growth as this segment has been trailing the company's two other units on this front. Regardless of all these changes, Johnson & Johnson will continue to generate solid revenue and earnings, just as it has in the past. Last year, the drugmaker's top line increased by 1.3% to $94.9 billion. Johnson & Johnson's adjusted EPS came in at $10.15, rising by 3.6% compared to 2021. The healthcare giant does face some issues, most notably a barrage of lawsuits related to its talcum powder products. However, Johnson & Johnson has a robust balance sheet -- with an AAA rating from Standard & Poor's -- and it is more than capable of taking care of its obligations. Johnson & Johnson has raised its dividend for 60 years straight, including by 71.2% in the past 10 years; its dividend yield is at 2.95%, also higher than that of the S&P 500. The company's cash payout ratio of almost 68% looks a bit high. But Johnson & Johnson's impeccable dividend record is unlikely to come to a halt anytime soon.  Both companies are solid dividend stocks. They even have comparable forward price-to-earning (P/E) ratios, with AbbVie's 14.3 slightly lower than Johnson & Johnson's 14.7. So income-seeking investors can't go wrong with either. But which one is better for dividends? My vote goes to AbbVie, but only by a very slight margin. The company has a higher dividend per share ($1.41 vs. $1.13) and has raised its dividends much faster than its peer in recent years. AbbVie's lower cash payout ratio shows that it can still afford to do so more than Johnson & Johnson, and what's more, AbbVie has a more attractive yield. Although the loss of patent exclusivity for Humira will be a challenge, AbbVie's revenue growth should pick back up in 2025. The company's business will be just fine over the long run and can support sustained dividend growth for a long time. Prosper Junior Bakiny has positions in Johnson & Johnson. The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Abbott Laboratories. The Motley Fool recommends Johnson & Johnson. The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy. *Average returns of all recommendations since inception. Cost basis and return based on previous market day close.

Learn More Shares of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ -0.54%) were moving higher today after the company got some favorable legal news. The healthcare giant reached a settlement worth $8.9 billion over allegations that talc in its baby powder and other products caused ovarian cancer and mesothelioma in tens of thousands of victims. While that might not sound like good news, the settlement had long been anticipated, and it removes a downside risk that had been nagging the company for years.  As a result, the stock was up 4% as of 2:24 p.m. ET. Johnson & Johnson had made several legal maneuvers to contain the damages from the claims, as its subsidiary being sued had filed for bankruptcy. The proposed settlement, which involves nearly 70,000 plaintiffs, would cover all current and future claims over Johnson & Johnson's products that contain talc, effectively putting the matter to rest as long as the court approves the agreement. In a statement, Johnson & Johnson said that it continues to believe the claims are "specious and lack scientific merit," but resolving them through the tort system would be more costly and take longer. The current settlement "allows claimants to be compensated in a timely manner, and enables the Company to remain focused on our commitment to profoundly and positively impact health for humanity."  While $8.9 billion is a considerable sum of money for any company, for Johnson & Johnson, it represents roughly two quarters' worth of profits based on last year's performance. That's a substantial penalty, but not large enough to jeopardize the future of the company. As negotiated, the settlement will be paid out over 25 years, meaning it would not have an immediate impact on the company's financial results. The deal still needs to be approved by the court and the plaintiffs, but investors clearly believe that this is a step in the right direction for the blue chip healthcare conglomerate. Keep an eye out to see if it gains court approval, as investors are expecting. Jeremy Bowman has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool recommends Johnson & Johnson.

AAPL (2023-04-05 22:00:38): Sign up for MarketBeat All Access to gain access to MarketBeat's full suite of research tools:  Heading into the first week of the month, Macy’s, Inc (NYSE: M) demonstrated they are no April fool as their pandemic emergence plan has put them in a furtive position. JP Morgan Analyst Matthew Boss raised Macy’s stock rating from Neutral to Overweight, bumping his price target from $28 to $29. And while so many other analysts may have stuck with their Hold rating, this seemingly innocuous jump also helped bump share value up 5.3%, to $18.42, on the news. Trading activity more than doubled to 21.34 million shares on the news.  The Wall Street investment firm noted that its upgrade came from growing confidence in Macy’s new plan to improve its bottom line. Specifically, the financial advisor anticipates M will provide several years of low-double-digit EBITDA margin. By comparison, the benchmark S&P 500 has maintained an EBITDA between 11 and 14 for the last few years.  At first glance, it would appear that Macy’s has been struggling for some time now, so this week's news is a bit of a reprieve from the sustained decline. If you didn’t know, M is down -22.82% on the month, down -13.11%  on the quarter, and down -27.85% on the year. At the same time, the retail sector is also down: -13.79%, -8.68%, and -26.76%, respectively.  That said, M’s $23.75 price target represents a solid 26.8% upside, so there’s a lot of light at the end of that tunnel. Although the current $18.80 share value is in the bottom 25% of the 52-week range, the stock is paying a strong dividend yield of 3.5%. Yes, the annual dividend is small–only $0.66–and the 15.75% payout ratio is a bit lighter, but the quarterly payout held strong at $0.16 for at least the last three quarters, only to finally increase to $0.17 recently.   News of the analyst upgrade is an encouraging change of perspective on a stock that has had some difficulties this year. Indeed, M remains down more than 22% since this time last year, following selloffs in February and March.  However, the liquidation is part of a focused restructuring effort emphasizing cutting costs. In 2020, Macy’s closed at least another 125 stores and cut several thousand corporate positions. Several dozen more followed in 2021, and then another handful in 2022. At the top of 2023, Macy’s had already revealed a plan to close at least another four stores. Selling off unprofitable stores saved the company $1.6 billion in 2016 alone.   The early April 2023 rating boost comes just about one year after Macy’s announced its new customer-focused “Own our Style” brand platform and “Mission Every One” social purpose platform. The initiative aims to reinvest $5 billion of allocated company spending to develop equity and sustainability among “our people, partners, products, and programs” through 2025. It would appear they are on track to achieve these goals.  More importantly, the “Own Your Style” platform and “Mission Every One” platform are part of Macy’s three-year Polaris Strategy. Specifically, this initiative aimed to: Indeed, Macy’s saw 68% of digital sales from mobile devices in Q4 FY 2022. The company now expects to register about the same for fiscal 2023. While growth is always desired, stability in a new program like Polaris is certainly not unwelcome. March 2023 marked the end of Polaris, and the program's successes have given Macy’s, Inc. a new foothold in this evolving retail environment.  On top of this, Macy’s new partnerships could help them to further expand on its new platform. DoorDash, for example, is on board to expedite Macy’s delivery offerings. In addition, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), PayPayl Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: PYPL), Venmo (a subsidiary of Paypal), and Klarna Express Checkout have all signed on to provide digital payment options. These expansions warrant a second look at why Boss at JP Morgan boosted M’s rating. Before you consider Apple, you'll want to hear this.

Learn More The banking industry, government regulators, and investors alike are still processing the March 10 collapse of SVB Financial, the parent company of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). It was the second-largest bank failure in U.S. history, with $175 billion in customer deposits on the line.  But this crisis had one unique (and worrying) feature: Just 6% of those deposits fell within the $250,000 deposit insurance limit mandated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Most of SVB's customers were technology companies, investors, and high-net-worth individuals, which meant the majority of them faced the prospect of a total loss. Thanks to prudent regulations that prevent banks like SVB from using customer funds to make risky investments, there actually wasn't an asset shortfall at all -- in other words, the bank was in a position to cover all deposits, it just had to liquidate its investment portfolios (it had an estimated $209 billion in assets at the time of failure).  Those portfolios consisted mostly of bonds and government Treasury bills, which are typically incredibly safe assets. But the rapid increase in interest rates over the last 18 months pushed the value of those bond portfolios lower (when a bond yields a higher interest rate, its value falls, and vice versa). At the same time, SVB's tech-sector customers were raising less money and burning through more cash, which was shrinking its deposit base. Additionally, customers were moving money to higher-yielding accounts, money market funds, and Treasury bills themselves to earn more interest on their deposits. A combination of those factors forced SVB to liquidate $21 billion worth of bonds and Treasuries at a $1.8 billion loss so it could meet depositors' requests. The bank then attempted to raise money from investors to plug that hole, and when word began to circulate the institution might be in trouble, depositors began to flee en masse.  SVB expected to lose a whopping $100 billion in deposits on the Friday that it failed which it didn't have the liquidity to cover, but thanks to a lightning-fast intervention by the FDIC, the bank was shut down before that could happen. It allowed the federal government to step in and announce deposits of all sizes would be safe, and it also gave the Federal Reserve time to set up an "at-par" lending facility to banks, which meant they could temporarily plug any financial holes caused by the declining values of their bond portfolios. This measure shored up customers' confidence in the rest of the banking system.  But this crisis came with important lessons attached, even if you don't invest in banks or financial sector stocks. Here's one thing technology investors can take away from the SVB collapse. A company has a strong balance sheet if it has enough cash and short-term liquidity to comfortably service its liabilities, like loans and other costs. Fortunately, the technology sector is filled with great examples -- two of the best are fierce rivals Apple (AAPL -0.98%) and Microsoft (MSFT -0.12%). Both have built their fortress balance sheets on the backs of their incredible cash-generating businesses. In fact, Apple brings in so much money it returned $104 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in fiscal 2022 (ended Sept. 24) alone. The company still has over $51 billion in cash, equivalents, and short-term marketable securities on its balance sheet, and since it spent only $9.5 billion servicing its debts in fiscal 2022, it still has plenty of runway.  Not to mention, Apple brought in $30 billion in net income (profit) in the recent first quarter of fiscal 2023 (ended Dec 31), so it's likely to continue piling up cash this year. Consumers love the company's portfolio of devices like the iPhone, iPad, and Mac computers, and its services including Apple Music, Apple Pay, and iCloud, so it's likely to remain a financial powerhouse for years to come. Microsoft is in a similar position, though it has a different strategy from Apple in that it invests heavily in entering new industries to expand its footprint in the tech sector. Having started out in software with its Windows operating system, the company now operates one of the largest cloud services platforms in the world, it's a leader in the gaming industry, and it's becoming a front-runner in the artificial intelligence (AI) space. In fact, it recently committed to a multiyear investment deal with ChatGPT creator OpenAI, which is rumored to be worth $10 billion. But Microsoft does have two things in common with Apple: Its cash position and its profitability. The company is sitting on $99.5 billion in cash, equivalents, and short-term investments, and in the recent fiscal 2023 second quarter (ended Dec. 31), it generated $16.4 billion in net income.  During what can only be described as a frenzy in the stock market during 2020 and 2021, many technology companies took advantage of their sky-high valuations to raise piles of cash from investors. As a result, they're sitting in a great financial position today even if their businesses aren't exactly performing well.  Investment platform to Generation Z Robinhood Markets (HOOD -0.93%) is one example. It has over $6.3 billion in cash with no debt, yet investors have sent its stock price plunging 88% from its all-time high, valuing the company at just $8.4 billion as of this writing. That means they attribute only $2.1 billion of value to the business itself -- in other words, the cash on Robinhood's balance sheet is worth three times as much as the business it operates.  When the pandemic era of government stimulus and ultralow interest rates ended in late 2021, Robinhood's young user base became less active in the financial markets. At the end of 2022, its monthly active user base had declined 46% from its peak in the year prior, coming in at 11.4 million. Similarly, the value of the cash and assets customers are holding with Robinhood is down 39% from its peak, to $62 billion. As a result, the company's quarterly revenue remained well below peak 2021 levels throughout last year.  Investors typically don't want to own shares in a shrinking business. Therefore, Robinhood's incredibly strong balance sheet won't be enough to buoy its stock price in the long run, making it a difficult company to invest in.  Anthony Di Pizio has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Learn More Although bulls were hopeful that the central bank would nix the idea of further rate hikes later this year, the decision of OPEC+ to rein in oil supplies this summer may force the Federal Reserve's hand. This situation doesn't bode well for the near-term economic outlook in the United States. This unfavorable setup shouldn't necessarily instill fear in stock investors. There are a fair amount of equities that can shrug off these macro headwinds to deliver respectable returns on capital in 2023 and beyond.  Image source: Getty Images. Top-shelf dividend stocks, for instance, ought to outperform in a bearish market. Here are two elite dividend stocks that can thrive even in a protracted bear market.  Johnson & Johnson (JNJ -0.54%) has a remarkable track record of producing market-beating returns on capital for shareholders. The company's success can be directly attributed to its AAA rated balance sheet, prudent capital allocation, 60-year history of consecutive dividend increases, and enormous investment in research and development, which has led to a steady flow of new blockbuster level products. In more recent times, however, the diversified healthcare giant has failed to live up to its high standards in terms of beating the broader markets. Key patent expiries in pharmaceuticals, a slowdown in medtech, anemic performance in consumer healthcare, and legal troubles have all weighed on J&J's shares since the start of 2018. At the onset of 2022, J&J appointed Joaquin Duato as its new CEO and tasked the industry veteran with changing the situation for the better.  Under Duato's leadership, J&J has moved forward with plans to carve out its consumer healthcare business, acquired the top-shelf medical device company Abiomed, doubled down on developing a best-in-class multiple myeloma franchise, and set the wheels in motion to possibly end the litigation over its talcum powder. This plan ought to unlock significant value for shareholders in the years ahead, despite more trouble brewing in the form of additional patent expirations in pharmaceuticals.  Bottom line: J&J is poised to return to form as a market-beating investment vehicle as a result of its ongoing makeover under its newly minted CEO. Meanwhile, investors can collect the healthcare giant's above-average dividend yield of 2.88%, which is well funded by the company's enormous free cash flows.    As a cyclical automaker, Ford Motor Company (F -0.51%) wouldn't normally be worth owning in an economic down period. But this is a highly unusual situation. Thanks to low inventory levels owing to supply chain constraints, chip shortages, and labor issues, automakers are widely expected to enjoy strong sales for the remainder of 2023, despite a bevy of macro headwinds. Put simply, there is a fair amount of pent-up demand for vehicles in the U.S. and abroad.  Ford, for its part, ought to benefit in a big way from this tailwind. After all, its market-leading F-series trucks are expected to dominate the full-size pickup truck category in terms of sales yet again in 2023. What's more, the legacy automaker's ongoing pivot to higher-margin vehicles should boost profit margin and free cash flow in the years ahead.  On the dividend front, Ford stock pays out an annualized yield of 4.83%, which is markedly higher than the average among S&P 500 listed equites. The automaker's sky-high dividend is also well supported by current operations, evinced by its meager trailing-12-month payout ratio of approximately 33%.   George Budwell has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Although most of us think of banks that take deposits when we think of banking, there are other types of banks in the investing world. Merchant banks are banks that help medium-sized businesses with a range of financial services. When a medium-sized business needs help with international transactions or financing, they have to go to a bank that’s made for them. They’re too big to borrow from a retail bank since they’re likely to need millions of dollars -- but they’re not big enough yet to engage with an investment bank for complex transactions like initial public offerings (IPOs). This is where the merchant bank comes in. These banks have been around for hundreds of years. They began as a way for merchants to loan money to other businesses but have evolved into banks that offer specific international financing and underwriting services to multinational companies. Handling international transactions is a service they offer; so is helping a company navigate financing from multiple sources, known as loan syndication. Some also help connect companies to various types of private equity.   Merchant banks are frequently confused with investment banks, but the two are very different. Investment banks are meant for huge transactions like IPOs, or other very large public and private share offerings. Their clients typically include institutional investors, governments, and huge multinational corporations. They can also assist with mergers and acquisitions, another service that large public companies need. Merchant banks, on the other hand, bridge the gap between retail bank business services for small businesses and investment banks. They typically service high-net-worth individuals or mid-level businesses with an international presence. They can handle a multitude of international monetary transactions and help companies connect to outside financing, either through bank lenders or private equity firms. They do not assist with mergers or acquisitions.  There are several services that a merchant bank can provide for its customers, including:  If you've ever wondered how banks make their money, read on. Investment banking refers to certain services that can be performed by financial institutions. Banks may seem complicated, but the way they make money is pretty straightforward. Bank collapses can have devastating effects on economies, causing a ripple effect of financial and social consequences.  Most of the world’s biggest merchant banks are also involved in other types of banking. These include banks like JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM  -0.19%), Goldman Sachs (GS  0.87%), Citigroup (C  -0.75%), Morgan Stanley (MS  0.76%), Deutsche Bank (DB  -0.18%), and Credit Suisse (CS  -0.13%). Often, these banks offer merchant banking as a separate branch of the company, potentially under different branding, to avoid conflicts of interest. This helps to prevent the mixing of services to businesses and preserves the distinctions between the commercial, merchant, and investment banking parts of the bank since this is a highly regulated sector. Many merchant banks are small, boutique operations that keep a very low profile. You may never hear about merchant banks unless you work for or own a company that uses them frequently. For example, Berenberg Bank is the oldest merchant bank still in existence, founded in 1540 and headquartered in Hamburg, Germany.

AAPL (2023-04-06 20:40:43): Sign up for MarketBeat All Access to gain access to MarketBeat's full suite of research tools:  Social commerce platform Pinterest Inc. (NASDAQ: PINS) stock has been a stalwart among social media stocks with a 19% year-to-date (YTD) performance and 10.8% one-year performance. Unlike Meta Platform Inc. (NASDAQ: META) Facebook, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google, and Snap Inc. (NASDAQ: SNAP), the mature social media platform has kept itself free of controversy and out of the crosshairs of regulators. Pinterest has grown its global monthly active users (MAUs) to 450 million, mostly comprised of women between 18 to 64 years old. Its global mobile app, which accounts for 80% of its impressions, grew 14% YoY. The company has focused on bolstering its personalization and video content, driving more engagement with a broader audience. Its advertiser mix is also expanding beyond retailers and packaged goods companies. Pinterest continues to expand its target audience to include more Gen-Z users. It released an app called Shuffles to the delight of the Gen-Z population. It's a trendy app that lets users create animated personalized collages comprised of images, cutouts, and music which can then be posted on other social media platforms. The flexible app has billions of pictures and cutouts available. Each collage piece can be moved around or resized to the user's preference. The app has grown in popularity on the Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) App store. It's number 96 in the Apple App store, behind the Pinterest app at number two, as of April 1, 2023. While not available for Android users, Shuffles has a growing wait list in anticipation of it.  On Feb. 6, 2023, Pinterest released its fiscal fourth-quarter 2022 results for the quarter ending December 2022. The company reported an adjusted earnings-per-share (EPS) profit of $0.29, excluding non-recurring items, versus consensus analyst estimates of $0.28, beating estimates by $0.01. GAAP net income improved to $17 million, while the full-year 2022 GAAP net loss was ($96 million). The company authorized a $500 million stock buyback effective the next 12 months. Revenues rose 3.6% year-over-year (YOY) to $877.21 million, missing analyst estimates of $886.78 million. Global MAUs grew 4% YoY to 450 million. Engagement sessions are growing "significantly faster" than users, which signifies deepening engagement per user, helping drive greater monetization per user. Pinterest CEO Bill Ready commented, “2022 was a solid year as we returned to MAU growth, deepened engagement and saw our personalization and relevance investments start to pay off. We’re building upon this foundation by staying focused on growing monetization per user, integrating shopping throughout the core user experience, and increasingly driving operational rigor.” His goal is to convert more intent into action getting users to spend more rather than just window shopping. Bill Ready was formerly COO of PayPal Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: PYPL) and Google. He became Pinterest CEO in late June 2022, replacing founder Ben Silberman. This fueled takeover speculation from PayPal during the summer of 2022. The hype has died down now as CEO Ready is proving his muster with his background in e-commerce, payments processing, and end-to-end customer experience. Pinterest expects fiscal Q1 2023 revenue growth in the low single digits, considering lower Forex headwinds than Q4 2022. Non-GAAP operating expenses should fall in the low double digits. On March 27, 2023, UBS upgraded Pinterest shares to a Buy with a $35 price target, up from Neutral with a $27 price target. Analyst Lloyd Walmsley raised his revenue, and EBITDA estimates for 2024. He cited that the continued improvement in Pinterest's ad tech drives more advertising dollars to the platform as advertisers get more bang for their buck.   The weekly candlestick chart on PINS shows a cup and handle breakdown attempt. The cup lip line was formed at $27.95 in April 2022 as shares fell to a low of $16.13 by May 2022. Eventually, a rounded bottom was formed as shares recovered towards the $25.26 market structure low (MSL) breakout trigger to retest the weekly cup line in January 2023. Shares peaked at $29.17 before falling back to $22.95, where they began to form a handle. PINS climbed back up through the weekly MSL trigger to attempt a breakout again through the cup lip line at $27.95, which peaked at around $29.17. The weekly stochastic has crossed the 50-band, so momentum is still early. The weekly 20-period exponential moving average (EMA) steadily rises to $25.45, followed by the weekly 50-period MA support at $23.21. Shares must hold above $27.95 to sustain the weekly cup and handle breakout. Pullback support levels are $25.26 weekly MSL trigger, $24.31, $22.56, and $20.21.

The company reported an adjusted earnings-per-share (EPS) profit of $0.29, excluding non-recurring items, versus consensus analyst estimates of $0.28, beating estimates by $0.01. GAAP net income improved to $17 million, while the full-year 2022 GAAP net loss was ($96 million). The company authorized a $500 million stock buyback effective the next 12 months. Revenues rose 3.6% year-over-year (YOY) to $877.21 million, missing analyst estimates of $886.78 million. Global MAUs grew 4% YoY to 450 million. Engagement sessions are growing "significantly faster" than users, which signifies deepening engagement per user, helping drive greater monetization per user. Pinterest CEO Bill Ready commented, “2022 was a solid year as we returned to MAU growth, deepened engagement and saw our personalization and relevance investments start to pay off. We’re building upon this foundation by staying focused on growing monetization per user, integrating shopping throughout the core user experience, and increasingly driving operational rigor.” His goal is to convert more intent into action getting users to spend more rather than just window shopping. Bill Ready was formerly COO of PayPal Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: PYPL) and Google. He became Pinterest CEO in late June 2022, replacing founder Ben Silberman. This fueled takeover speculation from PayPal during the summer of 2022. The hype has died down now as CEO Ready is proving his muster with his background in e-commerce, payments processing, and end-to-end customer experience. Pinterest expects fiscal Q1 2023 revenue growth in the low single digits, considering lower Forex headwinds than Q4 2022. Non-GAAP operating expenses should fall in the low double digits. On March 27, 2023, UBS upgraded Pinterest shares to a Buy with a $35 price target, up from Neutral with a $27 price target. Analyst Lloyd Walmsley raised his revenue, and EBITDA estimates for 2024. He cited that the continued improvement in Pinterest's ad tech drives more advertising dollars to the platform as advertisers get more bang for their buck.   The weekly candlestick chart on PINS shows a cup and handle breakdown attempt. The cup lip line was formed at $27.95 in April 2022 as shares fell to a low of $16.13 by May 2022. Eventually, a rounded bottom was formed as shares recovered towards the $25.26 market structure low (MSL) breakout trigger to retest the weekly cup line in January 2023. Shares peaked at $29.17 before falling back to $22.95, where they began to form a handle. PINS climbed back up through the weekly MSL trigger to attempt a breakout again through the cup lip line at $27.95, which peaked at around $29.17. The weekly stochastic has crossed the 50-band, so momentum is still early. The weekly 20-period exponential moving average (EMA) steadily rises to $25.45, followed by the weekly 50-period MA support at $23.21. Shares must hold above $27.95 to sustain the weekly cup and handle breakout. Pullback support levels are $25.26 weekly MSL trigger, $24.31, $22.56, and $20.21.

Well, you get a Mailbag with 18 pages of notes, all of which I love to read only some of which will fit on any given Mailbag episode, which is what this is, this month's Mailbag episode, joined by David Kretzmann, Andy Cross, and Tim Beyers. All four of us ready to give our best A's to you're awesome Q's. It's the March 2023 Mailbag only on this week's Rule Breaker Investing. Welcome back to Rule Breaker Investing. It's one of those months with five Wednesdays, which always makes us replete with lots to talk about in the Mailbag episode, we had four preceding episodes in the month of March 2023 here on Rule Breaker Investing. We started with Great Quotes Volume 16. While I didn't get any particular notes about Great Quotes Volumes 16 this month, I do just want to reiterate one of those five Great Quotes, of course, I love them all, I still enjoy doing that series over the years. Of course, that was Volume 16. How about the fifth and final one from the movie gladiator Proximo saying, "Win the crowd and you will win your freedom", that's advice in particular to entrepreneurs. If you missed that, if you feel inspired by that quote, if you love that movie or if you're an aspiring entrepreneur, I would highly recommend the first episode of this month. Great Quotes, Volumes 16. From there we moved on to blast from the radio past, got a lot of great mail about that. One of course, joined by my brother Tom Gardner and our longtime producer, Mac Greer. We went back over some of the hilarious quotes, at least in my mind, they get funnier as time goes by 20 years later from The Motley Fool radio show back in the day, a cavalcade of wonderful guests, Roger Ebert appearing on that episode, also, Loretta Lynn, the dearly departed. A delightful ramp back through the past, but looking at the pass-through present day lens, seeing what we can learn here in 2023 from what we were hearing in 2003, that was Blasts From the Radio Past Volume 4. A couple of weeks ago, The Science of Questionology, by 2023 revisit with Warren Berger, the author of the wonderful book, A More Beautiful Question, also The Book of Beautiful Questions and other books about innovation and business. A More Beautiful Question, Warren let us know, will be reissued in a new edition early next year. But what a wonderful opportunity to start to try to ask some of the best questions we can about our society or our businesses or ourselves to help change happen, to help new thoughts take root. Warren has been doing that for more than 20 years now as an author, helping businesses and people innovate. The Science of Questionology, two weeks ago, and then of course last week, the Market Cap Game Show, always fun. I think it was Andy seven Jim, three point one, I think that was the final score. But more importantly, how did you do? I hope you had a lot of fun on last week's Market Cap Game Show. Well, traditionally we start Mailbags with hot takes from Twitter, that's what I'm about to do. First one up, this one from my friend Mahan Tavakoli at Mahan Y, M-A-H-A-N-Y on Twitter, "Love Warren burgers work, had him on the Partnering Leadership podcasts, would love nothing more than to hear the always well-prepared, genuinely curious and deeply insightful DavidGFool asked him more beautiful questions". Well Mahan, thank you for those kind words. Warren is at Glimmer Guy on Twitter. But I'm flagging this because of my enjoyment of Mahan's podcast, so if you've not previously listened to Partnering Leadership, which he does twice a week, twice the frequency of this podcast, I highly recommend the wonderful work that Mahan does interviewing so many business authors and thinkers worldwide. Partnering Leadership, a favorite listen of mine, and if you haven't gotten a chance to listen to Mahan, who's obviously a fan of this podcast, well I think you should. Also, there was another plug, not on Twitter, but in the Mailbag which I'm going to include because I, as well as many others have enjoyed and listening in the past to Patrick O'Shaughnessy's podcast, which is entitled Invest Like the Best. I've had the privilege of being with Patrick on his podcast one time before, but apparently I didn't get to hear this one yet, but PT Lathrop, you wrote in mentioning your enjoyment of his podcast this past week. He had Tim Urban on. Tim, the author of the recent book, What's Our Problem?: A Self-Help Book for Societies, and that sounds like the book I'd enjoy. I think I'd like to listen to that podcast and maybe have Tim on this podcast as well. But I'm going to flag it for everybody who enjoys podcasts, especially ones that look at our culture, our society, especially ones that are business-minded, like certainly Patrick's wonderful investing podcast, Invest Like the Best is. Plugs for a couple of other podcasts inspired by some Twitter hot takes this week. Really appreciated this one from Harley Carol, at Harley M, Carol. Harley you wrote, "I very often learn as much about life as investing when listening to the Rule Breaker Investing Podcast, DavidGFool marinating on this concept from the other day you wrote just pondering the positive externality", Harley writes in one of the more impressively worded tweets that probably happened on Twitter this past month or so. "Just pondering the positive externality". Harley writes of civility, and is reacting I think, to Warren Berger and one of the points Warren made on our Beautiful Questions podcasts this month. Here's that line, Harley, that you are pondering on, " Question from a place of curiosity rather than from a place of animosity". I do think that is worth thinking a lot about and civility, one of my ongoing frequently referenced themes and topics of great interest, I think it's so important for our society. I don't just mean the United States, although I do, I certainly mean the world. Treating each other with civility, is something that has been lacking in recent years and is so important, and is so much happier. People actually being civil to one another lead to lower blood pressures and bigger smiles on both sides of every table. It doesn't make sense to me not to treat others with civility. Thank you for referencing that Harley. Then in the last one I'll mention just at Skins Fan Mike, Mike Gee wrote, "Rule Breaker Investing podcast listening to the review of palooza, I wonder how much time you would have to spend on picking five stocks now that you've stopped stock-picking", and I appreciate you mentioning that, Mike. Yes, I am no longer regularly formally picking stocks and a lot of the scaffolding that I had set up in place to enable me to do that on a regular basis multiple times every month for 20 years, I no longer have that scaffolding setup. I still feel like I've got the touch and I certainly think about it from time-to-time, but I really am focusing my attention these days on investing and business and life, and certainly the work at The Motley Fool Foundation would be one example. But I continued to care just as much about the stock market and my stocks and yours as ever I did, and that's why investing remains such an important part of this podcast, Rule Breaker Investing. Anyway thanks for that brief note Mike. Onto Rule Breaker Mailbag Item number 1, this is one of seven this particular month. Number 1 coming in from Sydney Steel who rocks in addition to a CPA designation. Sydney, you're also clearly a gamer, thanks for this note. "Hi David, I've written in before my husband's gaming podcast. But he loved your talk with CT Nguyen so much that he dedicated almost an entire episode to your conversation. Just wanted to thank you for a wonderfully thoughtful episode about games and the deeper side of gaming, plus the fantastic companion episode, we love role-player games too", wrote Sydney Steel. Thank you, Sydney. Well, I guess this is my month of plugging other podcasts. I haven't yet listened to this, but I'm certainly going to mention my appreciation that you leaned in and listened and cared. In fact CT Nguyen after appearing on my podcast, said to me offline, let me know if I get any feedback. I know you guys are investing podcasts, so you may not get many notes about my appearance, but I'd be interested in hearing them. Sydney, please know I've forwarded on that podcast, your husband's podcast to Thi as well. Tabletop Game Talk is the name of your podcast, your husband's podcast, Sydney, and specifically the episode Tabletop Game Talk number 325, and it's entitled, is Gamifying Life Bad, and I'm really going to enjoy listen to that podcast. Thank you for that. Slightly more broadly, I wanted to say two things before moving on to Rule Breaker, Mailbag Item number 2. The first is that very often I'm noticing with our Mailbags, I do them at the end of the month under the assumption that you're going to write me about this month's podcast. But so often my notes come in from the previous month. Of course, CT Nguyen and Gamifying Life and talking about games and investing was in February and well worth the listen and yes, we did secondarily do companion episode of bonus where we talked about which Tabletop board games we would each put on our respective Mount Rushmores. I had so much fun with Thi, I do look forward to having him back, I hope again this year or in future. From some listeners standpoint, I'm sure we talk about games, maybe too much on this podcasts and for some, others of us, we may not talk about games quite enough. I try to strike that middle ground is a lifetime gamer who believes that Gamifying investing is very valuable and leads to beating the market. I believe that Gamifying business is a lot more fun to be in business and makes it a lot more numerical about winning and yes, sometimes losing. I like to Gamify business and I Gamify life too in lots of different ways. Which we talked about some of that in podcasts and which I may talk more about in future. Because I think there are lots of ways to score life or think about rescoring life, or add fun and value to life by thinking about life as more of a game than many people seem to, so Sydney Steel and the purveyors of the Tabletop Game Talk podcasts, thanks for writing in Fool on. Rule Breaker Mailbag Item number 2, this one from Vince Granary. Thanks for writing in, Vince. But oh my gosh, wait, before I start reading this, David Kretzmann, welcome back to the Rule Breaker Investing podcast. David Kretzmann: Thanks for having me, David. Always great to be back. David Gardner: Well, the core progenitor without ever even meaning to of an important investment framework that we're going to talk about again this month, David, in addition to your job responsibilities, you are the co-founder of the Gardner-Kretzmann Continuum. But before we talk about that, David, would you just remind us what you're doing at the Fool these days? David Kretzmann: Sure thing. Right now I'm helping lead our product team, so anything and everything within product investing, everything that we deliver to our members. David Gardner: Excellent. Well, there's probably a good argument for me to have you on every month because a lot of the mailbag that I get are from Motley Fool members who have this or that thought about investing or sometimes our services directly, and indeed, you're always chipper, you're always present and you're back again this month. We're not going to talk I don't think as much about Motley Fool services that might come up, but let's start with Vince's node here. Because David, anytime you and I start talking GKC, it triggers even more mailbag items about the Gardner-Kretzmann Continuum. Here we go. Hi, D&D. By the way, that reminds me that the Dungeons & Dragons movie, which has gotten pretty good reviews is coming out this week. I, as a longtime D&D fan, will be headed to theaters for the rare direct ticket purchase Day 1 because it's gotten good reviews, it looks funny. David, have you ever played Dungeons & Dragons? David Kretzmann: I never had. My group of friends grown up did, but I never got into it. I'm sure I missed out on some fun times. David Gardner: Well, one D&D you're not missing out on is this D&D because that's what Vince is calling us, hi D and D. I'm not sure which David to take to task, he said Gardner or Kretzmann. Regarding David Kretzmann's statement that he had never seen "obscenely high GKC score." David, for the benefit of new listeners, what are we talking about before I go forward? David Kretzmann: The GKC is really a diversification measure that we conjured up almost a decade ago, you and I David on this podcast. Really it's a simple number. It's taking the number of stocks you own, divide it by your age, and that's your GKC score. Over the years it's essentially become a litmus test where I think we've generally agreed that everyone should have a GKC score of one or higher, just as a baseline diversification measurement. David Gardner: Well said. David, you are approximately how many years of age today? David Kretzmann: Thirty. David Gardner: If you're a fellow 30-year-old, congratulations by the way, listening to this podcast, we think you should have about 30 stocks in your portfolio. Now maybe you've just gotten started and you're like, wait guys, I'm at eight or 12, well, we think through the magic David of no commissions these days and a fractional share purchases through a lot of brokerages, you can get to 30. In general, why do we care about this kind of diversification? Why does it lead more often than not we think to success? David Kretzmann: I think there are a few different factors that go into it. The first one that's top of mind for me is just, from a behavioral perspective I think in general the more stocks you own, the better you'll sleep at night because you have less of your portfolio riding just a handful a few companies. Maybe it lowers the anxiety, at least for some. David Gardner: Which by the way is very important in life, right David, because it's not just about your stock market portfolio, it's often about your blood pressure, your longevity. How about any intimate family relationships you may have a spouse or partner. How you manifest yourself every day to the world freely does matter outside completely of your stock portfolio, but you and I know how many people, how many members have we talked to over the years, David, where our stock portfolios do affect how we think, how we act, and how we appear to others around us. David Kretzmann: Absolutely. I think there's behavioral lowering the anxiety or stress level of your portfolio, how you think about your portfolio day-to-day, year-to-year. There's another factor where research will show that generally speaking, the more stocks you hold and the longer you hold them, the better your odds of generating a positive return or having a successful outcome. Just from a math perspective, more stocks held for longer generally results in higher likelihood of positive outcomes. That's another factor. I think the third one for me is, it's fun. It's fun to hold more companies in your portfolio. If you have dollars at stake invested in a company, you're going to pay more attention to that company that the services and products that it's innovating and delivering on, a company's cultural impact, if it's trending the right direction, if it's becoming more relevant. For me it's behavioral, there's just the dollars and cents math, and then it's fun. David Gardner: That is a very succinct and elegant way of summarizing why we like to diversify. Not overdiversified necessarily, and that's where we're headed now with Vince's note, because he said that you said that you'd never seen an obscenely high GKC score, that would be somebody who owns way, maybe too many stocks relative to whatever their number of years on this planet is as a human being. Let's keep going with Vince's note. Now I love discussions about the GKC, Vince writes, as I have always considered myself a world record holder, or close to it. In fact, way back in 2018, I emailed you to explain that I had gone off the GKC score deep end. I was using what Vince calls the Noah Methuselah continuum score to express what others might have considered my over-diversification. I had well over 600 positions and I was 61 years old at the time, so my GKC score was greater than 10. By the way, Vince continues, I was beating the market, so my extreme GKC score did not turn my portfolio into a market index fund as some suggested it would. My logic was simple, I paid the Fool to make recommendations and who was I to decide which of them were better than others. I won't go into details about my allocation strategies, but my GKC mantra was, it's not how large you make it, it's how you make it large. I'm going to pause right there, there's a little bit more. Your reactions to his GKC mantra, David. David Kretzmann: This is so good. I aspire to be like Vince by the time I hit 60 or higher. This is a good goal, I think. GKC, 10 or higher, let's go. I still have ways to go. Setting setting the bar high, Vince, I love it. David Gardner: It's not how large you make it, although we're all trying to make our portfolios probably presumably as large as we can, not everybody, but most of us probably are. But it's how you make it large. There's a little bit of process here, David, trust the process. David Kretzmann: Yeah. What I like about this is very few portfolios will be set it and forget it. I think a lot of capital F, Foolish investors recognize like you and Tom with the Fool over the past three decades, it's a lifelong endeavor where you're continually looking at new companies, turning over new stones and portfolios. Our dynamic and companies come and go over time and some companies really thrive and others contracts. It's kind of a never-ending exercise and learning and investing in the world and companies that are becoming more relevant in the world. Investing isn't something that needs to just be draw a line in the sand set at one time, it's something that's really never-endingly ongoing. David Gardner: Very well said. We will finish Vince's note now with this because he goes fast forward to today. Vince says I'm 66 years old. I've spent the last few years consolidating and concentrating my portfolio with the knowledge gained from being a Fool for now 20-ish years. I took the opportunity presented by this roller-coaster market to reshape my portfolio, to better reflect my vision for the future, to quote a famous Fool Smiley. I have left the NMC world, that would be the Noah Methuselah continuum world of Vince's own making and returned to the GKC. My position's number about 250, so my GKC score is now under four. My goal is to wind up somewhere around two, so I still have some work to do. Thanks again for helping us to become smarter, happier, and richer. In this case, Vince closes less diversified. Well, it's a pleasure always to read such well-written notes. Vince, you've written in to this mailbag before and you're a fine thinker and writer. After all, language is the garment of thoughts, so I can see underneath your words, Vince, a very bright and Foolish fellow, David, any closing thoughts before we move on to number 3 here about his shift from the NMC to the GKC. David Kretzmann: Back to the GKC. All roads lead back to GKC. A score of two or four for the GKC, I think that's still a large amount of companies. I think most people responding to this note would probably think, man, whether it's 125 stocks or 250 stocks, that's still a lot of stocks. It's probably more stocks than most listeners right now holding their portfolios. But I think it goes to show that every person will approach investing in a different way. I think David where you and I have centered the conversation around is a GKC of one or higher, like that's the barometer for most people. Some will go as high as 10 or maybe even higher. There's some people out there who are looking at top Vince already. But I think we will generally agree that it's probably a minority of investors who should have a GKC below one, where it's a highly concentrated portfolio, spending a lot more time just hyper-focusing on 10 or 15 companies. Some people do that and they do it well, but that's going to be a minority of investors. So GKC, one or higher continues to be an applicable message. David Gardner: Onto Rule Breaker Mailbag Item number 3. Kind of a related note. David, I hope you'll stay with me. In fact, I've got one more for you. We're going to be joined by another special guest shortly. But let's go a little bit more GKC here because I think this is an important point made by our new friend, Hex. Hex writes, "Hi, David. I've been a member of the Fool US services since November 2019. I've been a listener of Rule Breaker Investing since then. I was previously a member of The Motley Fool's Singapore office." He writes, "Thank you for all that you do and the wisdom you share. I've seen my portfolio go as high as plus 40%, but the roller coaster ride also brought me to minus 10%." Welcome to the crowd, Hex. I think a lot of us listening this past year can relate to that whipsaw volatility. Hex goes on, "David, listening to the Fools and believing in the value of investing over the long-term and the just keeps swimming idea you share has kept me going. The February mailbag brought up the GKC and the sleep number. I would like to add my perspective to the perennial question, how many stocks should I own?" Now before I go forward, David, is this a question that were sometimes asked when people call into Motley Fool Member Services? How many stock should I own? David Kretzmann: Absolutely. How many stocks should I own? How do I know if I'm properly diversified? Right in the sweet spot I think of what is top of mind for a lot of investors, particularly after going through such a bumpy period in the markets over the past 12, 18 months. Definitely, a question that's top of mind and we hear it quite a bit. David Gardner: We do. It's the mailbag question I could probably answer just about every month because there's some version of it. We're not going to always touch base there, but it is good to return to some of the eternal verities time and time again. Let's go forward with, I think Hex is not just asking question though, but making an important contribution that we'll speak to in a sec. Hex goes on, the guidance from the GKC, or the commonly used numbers like 25 stocks or 30 or 40 stocks, does not address the concentration of one's holdings. I think when deciding how many stocks to own, an additional question should be, how many of your stocks make up 80% of your portfolio's value? Continuing on, Hex says, personally about 38 of Hex's stocks make up 80% of Hex's portfolio, another 76 stocks make up the remaining 20%. Quick math here, David, I'm seeing 114 stocks, again, a very highly diversified fellow Fool. But the important point is that about a third of those make up 80% of the portfolio, two-thirds of them, is there a Pareto principle emerging here? A little bit, maybe, 76 stocks making up the remaining 20%. "In total, I have 114 stocks," writes Hex. "My GKC is 2.7, but my attention could be focused on the 38 that make up 80% of my portfolio." Do you agree with that by the way, David, before we continue? Should Hex's attention be focused on the key ones that make up the bulk? David Kretzmann: I think that's a good way to approach it, focusing the bulk of your attention on the companies that make up the largest percentage of your portfolio. I think that's a good starting point. Again, depending on how much time or how fun it is for you to spend more time looking at companies, that'll certainly differ by investor. But I think as a starting point, that makes sense to me. David Gardner: Hex continues, "The other stocks are really small positions, thanks to the monthly recommendations from the Fool services I subscribed to. There are also tiny positions, I can relate to this as well, that are down 80-98% which just stay in my portfolio to remind me of the lessons I learned. I feel that this additional question helps to tease out more accurately if one's holdings are too concentrated or too diversified. Hope you find this additional question useful. I must admit, I'm surprised I've not heard anyone talk about this before. Foolishly yours, with a capital F, Hex." Well, let me start by saying, this is indeed something that we've talked about before. We don't talk about it all the time but then again, it's not even every month that we talk about the GKC, David, but certainly within Motley Fool services, so many of our members, many of whom listen this podcast, but we have a lot of listeners who are not members of the Fool. We hope that you are, dear listener, one day a member of The Motley Fool, like a couple of our correspondence this month, but many are just starting or they enjoy the free resources that The Motley Fool offers. They might not be aware that we think a lot about how you are allocated across the context of your personal portfolio. David Kretzmann: Absolutely. This is really the additional layer of diversification and allocation. GKC is just looking at number of stocks, but obviously there's a lot of different ways, as Hex's getting at, to slice and dice those stocks from an allocation perspective. Again, I think this is the type of thing where there's not a one-size-fits-all answer. There are certainly some general principles that we'll approach and many of our premium services when it comes to allocation. But when you're looking at stocks that make up 80% of your portfolio, there are a couple of different ways that you can get there. One is just through share price appreciation. Maybe you bought Amazon in 2003 or 2012 and you've held it for a decade or two and naturally it's grown to become a larger position in your portfolio just through the share price appreciating over time. Another way to get there, which maybe entails a little bit more risk because if you're putting more capital to work in a given stock from the beginning, so maybe you're allocating five times the usual amount to a stock that you feel really excited about compared to what you would typically allocate to a stock in your portfolio. That means right out of the gate, you have more of your original capital at stake in a given stock, so maybe a little bit more risk in that scenario versus where a given stock naturally appreciates to a bigger portion of your portfolio. A lot of different ways to slice and dice it but generally, I would say most of our investors would agree that you probably don't want to put more than 5% of your initial capital to work in a company from the beginning, maybe up to eight or 10% if you're a little bit more aggressive. But for the most part, probably start with 5% or less position in a company that you're adding to your portfolio. Follow that company over time. If you get more conviction in the company, maybe you add another slug of cash to that company, or ideally that company is performing well, the stock price goes up and it becomes a natural winner in your portfolio over time, so a few different ways to approach it. David Gardner: Very well said. You're keying in a couple of things, and then we'll move on to number 4 here. But you're keying in a couple of things that I've talked about in the past on this podcast in The Motley Fool services. That max 5% allocation does indeed accord exactly with what I've been saying for years now, which is I think that's the largest a starting position should be in your portfolio. In fact, there are six habits of the Rule Breaker Investor in number 5, and it's a mnemonic because it has the number 5 in it, is max 5% allocation. This I think is an important concept. I'm guessing a lot of our listeners know that but really, if you were to survey, David, the world at large, I think a lot of people wouldn't know what the right number is there or wouldn't have a developed viewpoint. Often I think the mistake made is? David Kretzmann: Investing too much too soon in one given company. David Gardner: Exactly. How often do we see that? Rarely is the mistake made not to put enough into a good company. That can happen too, although if it's a great stock, as it sometimes been pointed out, it doesn't really almost matter how much you put in because if it's a really great stock, you're going to do really well. I do want to point out that 5% allocation, I totally agree with that. Then one other is, this is in a past podcast I've done for Rule Breaker Investing, it's just how much time should you spend focusing on how many stocks? If you have 114 stocks like Hex, I certainly would be the first to say, spend most of your research time focused on ones that represent 5% or more allocation, if indeed any are in your portfolio. But you should be spending a lot more time with the three and five percenters than the 0.3%-0.5%-ers in your portfolio. That's an easy way of saying just focus on the ones that you have significant stakes in, and that's really where your research time should go. I guess, David, the one exception would be if you're starting a new position in something that looks interesting, it might be a tiny initial position. It sounds like that's the way Hex is using Motley Fool services, he's taking smaller initial positions. But you might want to spend more research time there if things look particularly interesting or promising. David Kretzmann: Absolutely. Again, different ways to approach it depending on how much time and interest you have in crafting your own portfolio. But I think there could be an argument to be made if the top of your portfolio, the heavily concentrated part of your portfolio is a little bit more boring and steady. Maybe you do spend a little bit more time on the research positions and maybe some of the companies that might be a little bit riskier, smaller, newer, and potentially build those into larger positions if they prove themselves out. David Gardner: Onto Rule Breaker Mailbag, Item number 4, for anybody who doesn't like the GKC, we're done with that. But David, will you hang on for another one? David Kretzmann: Always. David Gardner: Excellent. Thank you. We're also joined by The Motley Fool's Chief Investment Officer, Andy Cross, great to have you back. Andy Cross: Thanks, David. Hi David, two Davids, it's double David. I love that. That's special for me when I have two Davids. David Gardner: Thank you. It's good to have an Andy in here and Andy, great to have you back on this podcast. You were here winning the Market Cap Game Show last week. Was it emotional? Andy Cross: David, it was emotional considering that I think like many, my final four was completely obliterated. I was looking for a little bit of wins and I felt Jim was a contestant and a great friend, and that was a lot of fun and I was very happy with my performance. But what's most important is that it was just a lot of fun and it gives a lot of context to investing. David Gardner: Thank you. It was a lot of fun to do together and let's talk about this next note together, guys. This one comes from Justin Harrison. Justin, thank you for writing and hey, David, I've thoroughly enjoyed listening to Rule Breakers since I stumbled on it over two years ago. You're positivity and insight with investing business and life have been a staple for my weekend runs ever since that time and that's why I do this like that is so much fun. I would do it just for your runs, Justin. I mean, you know, you're loving what you're doing in life, if you would pay to do the job that you're doing and I don't tell anybody at the Fool, I would pay to do this podcast each week, even if it was just us running together. By the way, I need to get more steps, and OK, let's continue. I've been in public education for 14 years now, both in the classroom and as a school counselor. Saw your discussion with Warren Berger struck a more personal cord for me this week. Growing up, both of my parents were teachers. This has allowed me to see firsthand how that dynamic has shifted over the last four decades. Our education and questioning no longer synonymous, but instead two terms of conflation. Well, as an educator and a parent of two young boys, Justin writes, the thought of that is a concerning one to say the least, questioning and exploration of thought is imperative for learning to reach its full potential. Your discussion mentioned teaching to the test and that, in my opinion, has led to a number of issues in education that need to be corrected. By the way, guys, I don't know if this ever happened to you going through high school or college but some teachers feel a need to so-called teach to the test because often that standardized test that SAT or that API, whatever it is, or even just our school district or state test exam. They know the questions that are coming generally the teachers do and they need to teach students how to answer those questions and so, so much of teaching in some contexts. I see you both nodding your heads here as we do this over Zencastr, which is our video platform, although this is an audio-only podcast. But I see both of you nodding, that some teachers feel pressure to teach the test. They don't get time for exploration or questioning they need to get what's inside their heads, into their students' heads as efficiently as possible so students can regurgitate to get an A on the test. Andy, did you ever face this or feel this at any point in your own education? Andy Cross: Well, I think David, many people feel this. I will say, I've never been a teacher in education per se. I think I hope I help teach some investing. David Gardner: You're doing it right now. Andy Cross: Thank you. I hope I can have some appreciation, I certainly have appreciation of testing. What teachers have to deal with and what is the pressure they're under, from their administration, from their parents, from their performance is something I've never dealt with. However, I have thought often David, that healthy Socratic method, the ability to see different parts to different problems, the ability to understand how to ask the right questions, think for yourself that is really important in education and it's actually very important in investing because so many people on investing use one simple tool to try to value a company or value an industry or have one style of investing, instead of really broadening out their horizons. I think that broadening part allows you to find those winning stocks that we've identified at The Motley Fool over the years. David Gardner: Well said, thank you, and yeah, asking questions often leads to most of the gains we make in life. I think asking new questions, obviously, that's a major part of Warren Berger's work. Justin continuing as note, Andy would agree with you because he writes teachers do have their hands tied in all of this, when both federal and state funding gets tied to standardized test scores. There are opportunities to have meaningful time to build relationships with students and enrich the content are limited by that reality, leaving them with a watered down version of what could be. I'm sure that legislative policies like no child left behind and other various initiatives began with the best of intentions, but have instead, and again, this is from somebody on the front lines. I don't see this, my kids are now out of school. I'm glad that they're adults. That's why we raise them hoping one day there'll be responsible independent adults, which I'm happy to say we have in our family at this point. Anyway, instead perpetuated Justin writes, these shortcomings in our current system, unfortunately, we also know what destination that roads so ominously paves, although this all may sound bleak. I am hopeful that things can turn around in a positive and meaningful way. My state, Justin continues not identifying his state, but this is true of a bunch of the US states today. My state, along with numerous others across the country, have added financial literacy as a graduation requirement, whether furthering their education in college and listing the military or going straight to the workforce, students will now have that critical knowledge-base as they venture out into their post-secondary journey. That critical knowledge-based Justin's referring to is financial literacy. We're blessed to live in a country where despite our imperfections, we can create change through our electoral process. I myself want to do my part on the ground floor by being a catalyst for optimism and growth with all of the students that I encounter. Going to pause that right there, David Kretzmann, what jumps out to you in what I just shared? David Kretzmann: A strong plus one to everything and I'm glad we brought Andy on because he's saying things far more eloquently than I would be able to. But no, I think similar to Andy, I haven't been in the teacher shoes. But having been a student from my perspective I can understand where tests can be an effective tool just to capture that snapshot in time, did we get enough students over this knowledge threshold of a given topic? From my own perspective, though, whether in high school or college, as a student cramming for a test, I feel like I forget 90% of that within a week. And now looking back a decade plus, I don't really remember anything that I studied for in those tests. The things I do remember from high school and college, it's the experiences, the principles, some of those things that are certainly valuable. I think it comes down to the balance of book knowledge versus just some of the more foundational principles of how to live life effectively, how to navigate friendships and relationships and the world effectively, all those things. There's obviously nuance there, you don't want to go probably too far to either extreme. But I think looking at our system, I can certainly see where the pendulum is swung very heavily to the book knowledge snapshot in time, which I think is missing a lot of those qualitative aspects that make life so rich. David Gardner: Really well said. You were using the metaphor of walking in someone's shoes. That's so important today, especially because we have more awareness of more different people within our own culture to say nothing of the global culture, we're so much more connected with the outside world, even if we're in our dens, still some of us choosing to work at home, you're still so much more aware than humans were a century ago of people are very different from you. Walking and others shoes is such a helpful thing and I wouldn't be the truly Foolish person I try to be if I didn't make a joke about this as well because it reminds me of another great quote from a past podcast. This is about walking in someone else's shoes. It's from the actor now, dearly departed James Con, I don't know if you guys were listening to the episode, but if you weren't, you miss this amazingly great quote that you're now going to get to hear. Before you criticize someone, James Con tweeted once this is about two years ago, using Twitter to do this before you criticize someone, walk a mile in their shoes. That way when you do criticize them, you're a mile away and you have their shoes so worth considering. But let's move on to the close of Justin's and I want to end this message. He writes by going back to where I started it, I've been listening to you in following The Motley Fool for just over two years now, as we all know, the market has not been particularly kind to most investors over that time period. I fall into that category and have seen more losses than gains during this stretch. Even so, I firmly believe that the market will go up over time and this can be a wonderful opportunity for capital F, Foolish investors with a long-term horizon. I love the term spiffy-pop, Justin says, thank you Justin, and look forward to the day that I might achieve that return. Until then, I'm pleased to say that the information that you countless others at The Motley Fool the good folks over the investors podcast, and countless other financial writings have helped me Justin Harrison writes, achieve a mental spiffy-pop from where I began back in late 2020. With that learning compounded over time, I like my chances of making the type of investments that will lead to a prosperous and financially sound future. Fool on Justin Harrison. Well, Fool on yourself, Justin, what a great note. What proper sentiments guys, it hasn't been easy to find spiffy-pops, a term that if our listeners don't know, you just have to Google at this point because we can't go back over our language every time, every podcast, darn it, fellow fool, you should know what a spiffy-pop is. But if you do, you'll appreciate Justin's concept of the mental spiffy-pop, which anybody can achieve despite market conditions. I'm going to ask Andy to hang around for another mailbag item or two, but before you go, David, any final thoughts as you exit stage? David Kretzmann: I think the only thing that comes to mind, and there's probably some pitfalls to this idea, but a standardized test, I think, would be interesting in the context of high school college tests. Financial literacy would be a financial literacy tests that you need to take and pass before you can take on a student loan for college. I think that's an example we see. Often, an 18-year-old brain isn't even fully formed and you're taking on probably the biggest chunk of debt you'll take on in your life unless maybe you buy a house down the road. That's a huge commitment that most people I think have very little idea the ramifications of that literally often for decades for your life. If we're talking about standardized testing, I might be in favor of that one. Give it a shot. David Gardner: Thank you, David. I was going to let that be a mic drop and you're walking away in slow motion while everything blows up behind you because I thought that's such a great point. But without letting that happen, Andy wanted to jump in and add something. Andy, what? Andy Cross: Just David Kretzmann, such a great point, I would see that almost as valuable as four people taking on a credit card for the first time as well too and we're seeing the risk. Very similar to the college loan credit card as well too. But I think your point, David, was excellent. Thank you so much for making it. David Gardner: Well, to educate, to amuse, and to enrich. That's the phrase we rocked on the front of our AOL site back in the mid-1990s when The Motley Fool first launched and we're doing it just as much here 30 years later, guys, really good points. David Kretzmann, thank you for joining us again on Rule Breaker Investing. David Kretzmann: Thanks so much fool on. David Gardner: Onto Rule Breaker Mailbag Item number 5. And really I saw this Andy Cross in two different notes. I'll share Eric lounge note, first-year David, hello again from Hong Kong. Eric writes in last month's Mailbag episode, I appreciate you sharing item 2 about the dismal recent performance of a fellow Fools portfolios. Through being a Motley Fool member, I've come to learn the benefits of investing for the long-term, Eric writes, diversification, I think these are themes we've hit hard this month. How a few big winners can make up for a handful of losers. As a result, Eric writes, I am not rattled by last year's bear market and my conviction is as strong as ever. Having said that I do empathize with what some of the reader Greg shared in terms of the performance of the rule-breakers portfolio when promoting the Rule Breakers and Stock Advisor services, you referenced the performance versus the market since the inception of the service. That includes your most legendary stock-picks like Amazon and Netflix, to name a few. However, Eric ends for the sake of transparency, would you also be able to share the relative performance of these services for the most recent 5-year and 10-year periods. This information it's quite common to find and the promotional materials most ETFs and mutual funds, it would be helpful if such information Andy was also available for the various Motley Fool services. I know you have something to say to this, but I'm just going to add in one other note, short time reading a rather redundant notice to say is to show that it's on the minds of not just one person, but maybe many. It's worth thinking about together Andy. Cliff Cater writes, I'm reacting to Greg's note complaining about the dismal rule-breakers performance over two years and that it's laughable, he wrote, to keep referring to Amazon. I suggest you published 5, 10, and 15-year performance of all the services where appropriate. That'll help highlight their success over meaningful periods, but also encourage new members who may feel they miss the boat on those early picks. Andy Cross, I was going to say a penny for your thoughts, but I'm going to give you a dime. Andy Cross: Thanks, David. I hope is worth a dime. This is something we've discussed. Tom and I have discussed it, I've discussed from other investors and certainly discuss it with other Fools and other members and David, maybe even you as well too. We're very proud and we focus on the long-term here at The Motley Fool and so reflecting all of this success and all of the failures since the time we've started the services in Rule Breakers and Stock Advisor our two longest running services. Those are monthly recommendations services and we report those generally as an average return. Not generally we do as an average return on our scorecards. That is most meaningful reflected since inception. In some of our real, incidentally David, and some of our real money services though, the higher-end services that where we have Motley Fool capital invested in a portfolio that can be followed by our members. Those we actually track and we do report those since inception as well as rolling five-year periods. Stock Advisor Rule Breakers, we don't do it. I'm not opposed to doing it, we just want to make sure we reflect the right numbers because of the way that they are on an average performance. But we're so focused in trying to really teach members about the long-term and really stretching out that term that we're so passionate and so determined to make sure we highlight the since-inception returns because all of the recommendations are tracked on that scorecard. Any given time, anybody or any of us can see the individual performance of any stock and any month on those scorecards. The transparency is there and then that matches up with the since-inception returns. David Gardner: I think that's true and it's certainly I'm not going to say we take pride in this, I just think this is how every investment service should be focused. You can see every pick we've ever made when you join Rule Breakers or Stock Advisor, not just the last three years, or five years, or ten years. You can see every pick we've ever made, all the good ones and all the bad ones. You can also see exactly what we were saying all the way through from our initial buy report to our ongoing coverage, any Best Buys now, reports where we added that stock to a list of what we consider timely buys. Even when we sell stocks, you can find that they're too. We have a huge amount of content for people when they start a Motley Fool service, especially one of long vintage Andy. I think that that's really important to us. I think a lot of people do too tightly focus on the last one year or the last three years of their portfolio, or their fund, or services that they're looking at. At the same time, I would say I think the reason that Eric and Cliff have written in about this and presumably discussions in our Motley Fool discussion boards and other aspects of our services is because I think it is a benchmark that people use, hey, how has a given service done over the last ten years or five years. I don't see any real problem with showing all of the above. I think the inception returns are most important to me. I think what's the greatest value that The Motley Fool offers to the world in some ways is that long-term track records. So much of the world is caught up in five-year returns and what has it been, and doesn't realize that it's about five decades of holding stocks. I think we're so highlighting that under your leadership, Andy, returns since inception say so much, I think, to a lifetime investor and spending a lifetime we hope with our services through good times and bad where a lot of people jump off the train if they just see a bad returned over three years or Andy, the last five-years, if it looks spectacular, maybe they go into strong are too high because like these guys can't lose, look at the last five years. It's hard to solve the equation for everybody and every context, Andy and what everybody might want from our services. But I think the points here are well-made. I'm sure you're hearing them, you think about them, and I know also a bunch of our services do that. The ones that use real money to manage a portfolio in front of our members. Andy Cross: Exactly David. With Stock Advisor and Rule Breakers because we list every single recommendation we've made over 20 plus years for Stock Advisor and 18 years for Rule Breakers, David, 17 years for Rule Breakers. The transparency is right there that matches up that since inception returns. The matching of that I think is really important and then transparency of that. Perhaps we should have more conversations about highlighting some of those shorter-term periods. But I think your points are certainly correct in a way that I know Tom feels and I feel, which is the continued focus on expanding on our time horizon beyond just one, three, five years that is so touted in the invest in media and really thinking about decades of performance because over that time period, you can't say it's luck, it really is truly representative of your invest in talent. I think that's what we want to showcase in a style with what we've done at Stock Advisor and Rule Breakers. David Gardner: Well, let's move on to Rule Breaker Mailbag Item number 6, I will just say in passing and you can imagine if you're a marketer and you work at The Motley Fool, you probably just like if you're marketing, Chobani yogurt, or let's go with latest Chipotle has some new meat, or something. The new chicken from Chipotle that you're always going to want to put your best foot forward. It doesn't make sense to say, hey, we've had really bad returns over the last three years in Rule Breakers, because by the way, the market and Rule Breakers stocks have had really bad returns. David Gardner, the progenitor in some ways of that service, hasn't had great returns over the last three years. They're going to want to show you how we've done over the longer-term than that, where we're well beating the market for members who've been with us for a long period of time, which is to us the only period of time that matters. But anyway, I can certainly appreciate that if you're a marketer at any company, you want to put your best foot forward and lead with that. I think since we have such an incredible long-term inception starting to tell. That's why we tend to do that, but I won't speak for that group. Hey, I'm not even in operations. I'm just a co-founder that does a podcast in a weekly basis. Andy Cross, thank you for speaking to that. Let's let's go to Rule Breaker Mailbag Item number 6, Andy hanging around for this one. But when you and I were battling this around before we came on the air, you said you'd shift Tim on for this one. Tim Beyers, welcome back to Rule Breaker Investing. Tim Beyers: Thanks for having me back, David, good to be here. David Gardner: I feel a little silly saying welcome back to Rule Breaker Investing since every day you're working in for Rule Breakers and anybody who's a member of our services would know that about you. But I guess I'm just talking about this podcast. It's a delight to have you back. You've made many past appearances for good reasons and this is just the latest. Are you ready to talk to this Mailbag item from Phil? Tim Beyers: Absolutely. Let's hear what Phil has to say. David Gardner: Let's do it. David, after having one of a few conversations surrounding GAAP, generally accepted accounting principles, GAAP. That GAAP, G-A-A-P, and non-GAAP comments related from the discussion board on The Motley Fool that discusses Cloudflare, which is ticker symbol NET. This is another member guys. This is a guy who's dropping notes in our community on our discussion boards about GAAP and non-GAAP investing. Field continuous. I began to question some of the advice I was getting from that discussion board. By the way, that advice would be coming from fellow members usually. There are staffers, Tim, you might've been posting on the Cloudflare board, or Andy, but often it's member-to-member communications going on there. Anyway, he began to question some of the advice he was getting from the board and made the decision to move on and explore other ideas. I guess he, he moved on from that discussion. They didn't like, or agree with what I was saying, says Phil. He even uses this verb guys and canceled my humble opinions. Now, pause for a sec there. That feels a little sad to me, Andy. Andy Cross: For sure, David, we are a forum where we welcome contrary opinions, learning, discussions as how we all get smarter. Especially in this day and age cancel is have very strong word so I hope Phil is not canceled. David Gardner: We don't cancel people at The Motley Fool, but I'm sorry if you felt that way, but you're getting your moment Phil because here we are. Rule Breaker Mailbag Item number 6. Now Tim, let me keep reading here. My question is this, does The Motley Fool Rule Breakers have a blind spot when it comes to GAAP and non-GAAP accounting practices? In a recent podcast, David, you highlighted a new investor who is disgruntled with your service, you apologized and gave a reasonable answer as to how the market works. Having been around a long time and journaling my investments, I am way further ahead by following the Rule Breaker recommendations than I would've been without the investment advice even with all the recent losses and Phil, you know that warms my heart. Thank you, sir. Thank you. He writes for the record, I do cherry pick. I look for companies that adhere to GAAP accounting principles. Tim, we're about to get into this, but let me just add a little bit more. Here's what I believe is a Rule Breakers blind spot. Upon The Motley Fool's recommendation, investors decided to invest in the companies say Cloudflare, or the Trade Desk and enter through the front door. The front door here means is GAAP and GAAP accounting. Now, a lot of listeners know what we're talking about, but a lot of other listeners don't know exactly what we're talking about at this point. Tim, in a second I'm going to ask you to briefly break down the terms before answering Phil's question. But he's talking about that front door. They buy that stock through the front door, GAAP accounting. These are great companies with great models, Phil rates who generate a tremendous amount of revenue, but revenue minus expense and liabilities equals profits, or losses. The problem is that when you invest using non-GAAP accounting principles, which Phil terms the back door. The back door is wide-open. As often happens, stock options not being recognized as an expense, escape out the back door, leaving investors left holding an empty bugger. He uses that phrase, I'm going to pause right there. Tim, can you break down what's happening here? Tim Beyers: Essentially what Phil is saying is that when a company gives out a lot of equity, so stock options are one way it can be done and other restricted stock things. They give stock, they give equity compensation to employees. That is equity that could be available to shareholders, but it gets diverted and it goes to the employees. Basically what Phil was saying is come on in the front door, I'm going to shuffle some money to employees out the side door. When you go out the back door, some of the maybe the equity gains I promised you have already gone to the employees and you're not getting the full share here. I think Phil is saying, look, I want a company that is going to expense everything properly, is going to abide by GAAP generally accepted accounting principles. Not give me a bunch of numbers that are non-GAAP to say, essentially it feels like a Jedi mind trick. I'm putting words in Phil's balance here, so I apologize. David Gardner: I think doing it very well. I think Phil is nodding his head possibly vigorously. Tim Beyers: I would say he's making the argument. This feels like a Jedi mind trick. These are the numbers you're looking for. If you're looking at GAAP over here, don't pay any attention to that stock-based compensation expense look at these better numbers over here. Phil, I think he's making the argument that those non-GAAP numbers are deceptive and they're hiding the fact that a lot of money that could go to shareholders instead goes to employees and he's not digging that very much, David. David Gardner: At the heart of this Tim, you got stock options, or stock grants that are being given to employees and they're not being paid a salary. You're not actually seeing the full salary composition what you'd expect it would cost for a techie in this world, or a good digital marketer. Instead, you gave him some stock, or some stock options and that's not reflected in that front door accounting that a lot of people want to see. They want to know the full expense that it costs, but if you're just giving people stock, by the way, stockholders are being diluted. As you're pointing out, they're not getting the full effect of that pie that they got an initial slice of portions of that pie are disappearing because it's being given away by management. Cynically, we could say hiding expenses. This is a common practice, Tim Beyers, an Andy Cross for many innovative upstart companies, a lot of Silicon Valley fueled by this. It is best sense in some ways, Tim, right? Tim Beyers: Yeah. David Gardner: Maybe it's worse too? Tim Beyers: Yes. We can absolutely get into that. I would say the problem with thinking about any equity compensation. Essentially what's happening is all of this stuff If you know your accounting rules, there's an income statement where we look at the profit and the loss and everything gets expensed, including some things that aren't cash expenses, like equity compensation and then we move from that to the balance sheet where we say, here's how much we got in the bank. Then to the cash flow statement where we say, here's the cash that's flowing through the business. On that cash flow statement, some of these companies you're talking about, David will get a really big fat credit. Said, hey, we actually didn't spend cash. That compensation that was expensed on the income statement, that's now credit back to us because no cash went out the door. These companies will say hey look, we're cash flow positive. Except they got what I call the big fat artificial sweetener benefit of being able to defer a lot of expense they'd have to pay in cash. They instead paid it in equity and so Phil is pointing out, and I think rightly. When a company does that, you're like, hey man, you're taking money from me as a shareholder. What do I get for that? David, I want to give full credit and say that is exactly the right question to ask but don't let the question hang. You got to ask the question and then you got to do a little research because context matters and I'll hand it back to you, David, with this point that we can get into a little further. Sometimes when a company does that, it is absolutely to the benefit of shareholders. Sometimes when a company does that, it is absolutely not to the benefit of shareholders and so it is never, and when this happens, it's bad, it depends. David Gardner: I hear you there. It depends. Andy Cross, you've watched this phenomenon for decades. You've been at The Motley Fool even longer than Tim Beyers has been with us for decades. Andy, this is something I remember in the early days of the Fool. I won't name this wonderful investor that we both know that we've worked with over the years. But this person was targeting Activision. Activision Blizzard is a company that was a serial pair of stock to its employees, hiding its expenses and didn't like this stock and I will just say I downplayed it. It's not to me, it can work out well. If you pay employees in stock, not salary cash and the stock goes up over time, that's actually a win-win really. I think it's a win for everybody so I recommended Activision anyway, Andy, and it's been a pretty great stock over the years. Not to say this is about a single-stock because I think Tim's point, Andy it's an either or. It can work both ways here. Andy Cross: Well, and David, it's mostly acute and in information technology and the most innovative companies, and not mostly, but they reward a lot in stock. That is part of the currency of Silicon Valley and the way they recruit and the way they maintain the way they incentivize their employees. Years ago when we first started, the stock-based compensation wasn't even part of the income statement they didn't include it I forgot that. Now it's at least included and then companies will back out the stock-based compensation so Cloudflare, for example, had probably close to a billion more than a billion-dollar of expenses last year and about north of 200 million of that was in stock-based compensation, that is into the income statement. Then when companies go to report their earnings and talk about their cash flows as Tim mentioned, they back out that stock-based compensation because they didn't shuffle a bunch of cash out the door in salary expensive. Instead, they prefer to give it out in equity grant but that is the real trick into Tim's point about the context and looking at a case by case and with your case Activision. I remember looking at this with Netflix many years ago two with stock-based compensation and people getting criticizing the company for stock-based compensation that overtime has worked out very well for those employees. It's really as an analyst and investor, you have to recognize the expense and look at both the volumes and also the underlying business obviously to see if that stock is going to get rewarded not just for those employees and turn out to be a reward for the employees, but obviously for the shareholders and then how much, as you mentioned David, the dilution, which means as you issue more and more shares, those of us who own that stock get a little bit less and less of that company if you're doing that at a really obscene amount then the dilution is pretty insignificant over time. David Gardner: Right. Fortunately, these numbers are more available and more transparent than ever before, which is why even mom and pop investors like me can roll up our sleeves if we want to go in there and the 10-K and have more awareness of this, which companies do this? The most or the least if there are any egregious players here, etc. Tim, I'm going to close by asking you whether you think this is a blind spot, that we have a Motley Fool, Rule Breakers. But before I ask you that, I'm going to let you cogitate on that as I read the end of Phil's note, Phil's ends his note with ''If you buy into companies who do not adhere to GAAP, as an investor, you will be paying hefty prices for stocks you purchase and we'll continue to see hard-earned money exit through the back door when stock options are granted to the tune of hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars.'' Something to think about. Now, Tim, I think you did a good job pointing out earlier, Phil can be right. Phil is right in some situations, but this is not an always right viewpoint. But Tim, do you feel like Motley Fool Rule Breakers has a blind spot here? Tim Beyers: I think we might have in the past, but I've spent a lot of time thinking about this and I think the way I would caveat Phil's comment is maybe like what he said at the end of that, it always goes out the door. You have to put in my opinion, Phil, you have to put a maybe on that so let me give you some context here. Remember I said the question you should ask is, what do I get for that? Because there is money going out the door. I'm going to give money to employees so what do I get for that? I get diluted as a shareholder so what do I get back? The way I think about this, David, is, I think of those equity grants as investments made in building something, particularly among any information technology company that neither you or I can't see. It's general software. We know value is created. If I could give you an example here, the net intangible assets, the gross forever of the Microsoft Corporation is $23.5 billion. Microsoft makes over $200 billion a year in revenue. Do we really believe that the assets that Microsoft has created is only worth $23 billion? That is nonsense. We know that's nonsense. We know that there are investments being made here and those investments invariably are being made in people. David Gardner: That was really well put Tim, you remind me how well you break down complicated concepts. Sometimes you do it about technology. This time you're doing it about investing and GAAP principles. Did you say 23 billion, is that what you just said about Microsoft? Tim Beyers: That's the forever number. David Gardner: You think about the market cap of Microsoft is over two trillion. That's a small insignificant percentage really looking at the grand scheme and that's what we're doing right here, looking at the big picture of its forever grants, and it's today's market cap built-up over decades. That's just one example. I think in closing, you can pick your poison here. If you want to make a point scoring and feels calm, you can find companies that have been bad decisions in our cynically hiding expenses and hurting shareholders badly and they exist. You can also find companies that might not be so cynical. They may think of this as a compensatory tool that's very effective and they've gone on to create huge wins for all their stakeholders, certainly shareholders included. I hope we've painted both sides of the fence. I know when I bring in Andy Cross and Tim Beyers, we're going to do that because we tend to be what we shoot for being as broad-minded and seeing all sides as possible. That's, I think part of The Motley Fool's special sauce part, and it was on evidenced today. Tim and Andy, I want to thank you both for leaning in with me this month on our Rule Breaker Investing Mailbag. Andy Cross: Thanks, David. Tim Beyers: Thanks, David. David Gardner: Well, that was a lot of fun. I said just off the air to both Andy and Tim. I think for some of you fellow Fools, our listeners, you're like guys that was keep that topic short-shrift. You can go a lot deeper, and I bet that's true for some of you. I also think others listening maybe a majority or like maybe five minutes on GAAP is all I really need. Hyperlinked to stop on your website if you like, or we can go infinitely deep on an HTML page. I'm often trying to strike it with the golden mean of how much time should we talk about GAAP accounting or not with this large audience? Anyway, thank you for bearing with me. If you are a longtime listener, you know that I often tried to close many of my podcasts, especially my mailbags with the best for last. Let's see if we got it with Rule Breaker Mailbag Item number 7. Before I read Jason Trice's note, I want to say that Jason has been a frequent correspondent to this podcast through this mailbag over the last few years. Jason Moore, who is also recognizing in this note, has also been just as equally engaged in. To both of the Jason's, I want to say thank you, you guys are not only a pleasure to, in some senses work with, even though it's purely informal and largely writing back-and-forth on the mailbag, but also on Twitter. Both of you are active and great follows on Twitter. Jason Trice, you are at Jason_Trice, and Jason Moore you are at JimminyJilickrz. That's Jilickrz J-I-L-l-C-K-R-Z for those who are spelling at Twitter handles as they do their weekend jog lists, podcasts. But at JimminyJilickrz and Jason_Trice have been wonderful Fools, and so this is a great tribute to close out this month's mailbag. Rule Breaker Mailbag Item number 7. Hey, David, I hope you're doing well, it's Jason Trice. This was a fantastic month of podcasts for Rule Breaker Investing. I enjoyed each one. I'm writing to let you know about a friendship that has developed due to your weekly podcast. Here's the story. It's entitled a Rule Breaker Friendship. About once every other week, I do an hour-long FaceTime call with a friend of mine. Our friendship is unique for several reasons. One of which is we've never met in person. Jason lives in Canada and I live in North Carolina. We are about the same age. We have young children and aging parents and have similar interests. We discuss everything from books we're reading to complicated families situations. Our conversation started on a surface level, but the more we talked, the more we connected and the deeper our talks became. Jason has helped me through some difficult times and I have also helped him through some, it's a friendship I value deeply. Why am I telling you this? Because you introduced us. Jason and I initially connected through a shared interests in the Rule Breaker Investing podcast. It started with comments on Twitter and eventually led to a Zoom chat where we discussed our favorite RBI episodes and speculated on which authors would make the cut for authors in August. Our conversations have evolved. We usually start with an episode of the podcast, which always leads us in an interesting direction. The last time we spoke, I began to think about how unique and special our friendship is. When you started recording the podcast in 2015, I don't know what your goal was. I can guess it was probably centered on educating, amusing, and enriching. It has undoubtedly done each of those for me. But my friendship with Jason reminds me that when we put good things out in the world, the world rewards us with things we didn't know were possible. Why am I typing this long-winded message? I want to say, thank you. Each week I hear you're smiling voice. You know you're optimistic when listeners can tell you're smiling, and I'm thankful for the good you continue to put out into the world. It's created a wonderful community that connected two unlikely friends living thousands of miles apart. Without your podcast, we would've never met. It's what I call a Rule Breaker friendship. I hope to meet Jason face-to-face one day perhaps at a FoolFest. But even if we never meet, I will continue to look forward to our chats and always be grateful to you for introducing us. I imagine there are several other stories like this out there. I didn't want another month to pass without sharing mine. Thanks, David and fool on. Well, to Jason Trice to Jason Moore too, I hope many others who have made or met a friend through not just this podcast though of course, that makes me smile, but through The Motley Fool, through the connections that we make at member meet-ups, through investing clubs we might have started online, or maybe bumping into a fellow shareholder at your Starbucks. As you both realized you own, SBUX shares, the connections that we make through the businesses we're invested in together. But I think even more importantly, through this shared mindsets that we often have valuing the long-term, which Jason and Jason, I know you guys do and I hope so many others listening to me right now, realizing that's the only game that counts, the long game, working for the good of ourselves and others in this world often through how we spend our money and how we invest our money, and realizing that most of us are trying our best. No one is perfect, and yet, if you're Foolish enough with a capital F, to admit you're a Fool. If you can start there, that opens up any number of conversations gives you a beginner's mind humility to who you are and where you're coming from, which is appropriate for every human being on this planet. Without being too grandiose, Jason, I so appreciate you taking the time to write that note, it accords to my own belief that the expression of gratitude is itself helpful. I wish both of you guys Foolish and long lives. I hope those Zoom chats continue, I know you'll meet in-person one day, and I so value my connection with you each and my connection with so many others listening to me right now, both the past connections that we may have had sometimes over decades, the present connection that we enjoy right now through the human voice on a podcast you can download this week. Of course, more importantly, really, all that really matters, the future, the future connections that we may share and enrich each other's lives.

Learn More "Should we develop nonhuman minds that might eventually outnumber, outsmart, obsolete and replace us? Should we risk loss of control of our civilization?" These questions were asked in a March open letter referring to artificial-intelligence (AI) technology -- an open letter signed by Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, and thousands of more people. Many of the signatories believe that AI poses an existential threat to humanity and they want to do something about it. "We call on all AI labs to immediately pause for at least 6 months the training of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4." GPT-4 is the conversational AI chatbot developed by OpenAI in partnership with Microsoft that's taken the world by storm. This article won't explore the potential impact of this letter on the world of AI. I'm more interested in what companies are promising buys regardless of AI's future. If AI technology were to be paused tomorrow, I wouldn't expect Amazon (AMZN 3.03%), Xometry (XMTR -6.21%), or CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD 1.82%) to skip a beat. Here's why. Don't look now, but Amazon stock is actually underperforming the market over the past five years, just a 46% gain compared to a 55% gain for the S&P 500. There are good reasons the stock is coming up short right now. The bulk of its business is in e-commerce, and e-commerce-related expenses have skyrocketed. Looking at the 10-year chart of Amazon below, there's an amazingly strong correlation between the company's stock price and its operating income. In 2022, its operating income fell 51% year over year to $12.2 billion, largely because of the aforementioned issues with e-commerce costs in North America. For perspective, full-year operating income for just the North America business segment dropped by more than $10 billion from 2021 to 2022.  AMZN data by YCharts Operating income for Amazon's North America business segment is poised to rebound in 2023 and beyond regardless of what happens in the world of AI. According to management, its operating profit took a $2.7 billion hit in the fourth quarter of 2022 just from layoffs, property and equipment impairment charges, and changes in liability estimates for self-insurance. Many of these charges should be non-recurring. Even if Amazon's revenue growth slows to a crawl, merely making improvements to its operating margin should help the stock regain ground. That's a big reason that I believe Amazon stock is undervalued today. To be clear, Elon Musk and others aren't necessarily against all forms of AI. The technology exists on a spectrum and many tech companies, if not most, already employ at least some form of AI. And this includes manufacturing marketplace Xometry. On March 30, Xometry released new product features driven by AI -- the kind that wouldn't be paused under Musk's proposals. The company's technology can now provide buyers with instant quotes for certain custom manufactured items. For buyers, this speed can be an incredible value proposition. Traditionally long lead times in manufacturing can be a source of frustration. Xometry isn't well known -- it's a marketplace connecting third-party manufacturers with buyers. But its marketplace is fast-growing. Full-year 2022 revenue was up 75% year over year to $381 million. And, importantly, active buyers surpassed 40,000 in 2022, up 45% from the end of 2021. By enhancing the value proposition of its platform with AI upgrades, it could keep gaining adoption for years to come. If Xometry can continue growing, that would be great for shareholders because it's getting more profitable with scale. The company's gross profit grew 158% year over year in 2022 -- far outpacing revenue growth. And its gross margin in the fourth quarter of 2022 was 37% compared to 31% in the prior-year period.  XMTR Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts Xometry went public less than two years ago and still has a lot to prove. But it's growing and getting more profitable with scale. Cybersecurity is one of the great secular growth trends of our time. And that reality has nothing to do with the rise of AI chatbots. If advancements in AI were paused tomorrow, the cybersecurity market would still be growing by tens of billions of dollars annually. For example, third-party research company Fortune Business Insights believes it will grow from about a $140 billion market in 2021 to a $376 billion market by 2029. CrowdStrike is a cybersecurity player that investors should take seriously. In the company's latest presentation, it cites third-party data from International Data Corporation (IDC). According to IDC, CrowdStrike grew revenue and market share more than any other endpoint cybersecurity company from July 2021 through the end of June 2022. CrowdStrike appears to be gaining market share for a simple reason: Its platform has 23 different cybersecurity modules, addressing a wide swath of disparate cybersecurity needs. Over time, its customers keep adding new modules to their subscription packages. At the end of fiscal 2023 (ended Jan. 31), 62% of customers had five or more CrowdStrike modules, up from just 2% of customers in fiscal 2018. Most of CrowdStrike's customers still have room to add additional modules over time, giving more revenue upside. Moreover, the company is still adding new customers at a rapid pace -- nearly 1,900 net new customers in the most recent quarter alone. And the overall market opportunity is still growing as well, as already mentioned, which points to higher revenue for CrowdStrike long term. AI may be a hot news topic and one that investors are understandably excited about. But I hope it's clear that CrowdStrike's growth isn't dependent on the adoption of AI -- its development could be paused and CrowdStrike would still have a large growth opportunity. The same is true for Amazon and Xometry.  Therefore, if you're an investor worried that Musk's letter will hit the brakes on AI, then take a look at these three stocks.

Learn More The cybersecurity industry attracted approximately $168 billion in spending from businesses in 2022. But according to a report by McKinsey & Company, that's nowhere near enough to protect against the growing threat landscape created by the widespread adoption of digital cloud-based operations. To put it in perspective, the firm estimates the damage caused by cyberattacks will reach $10.5 trillion in 2025, increasing 300% from 2015 levels -- corporate spending on protection sure seems tiny by comparison. Image source: Getty Images. McKinsey thinks companies should be spending up to $2 trillion collectively on cybersecurity products and services right now, more than tenfold what they're actually spending. That means there's a value gap of about $1.8 trillion, and while there's no guarantee it will be filled, there are signs the corporate sector is growing more conscious of its need for these services. In a 2022 survey by Morgan Stanley, leading corporate chief information officers said cybersecurity was the last expense they planned to cut, even if an economic recession occurs. Governments, investors, and customers are increasingly holding companies to a higher standard when it comes to protecting their information. Data breaches and ransomware attacks are constantly making the news, which has put executives on notice; the consequences are no longer simply financial, as it can be difficult to recover from the reputational hit, too. According to the McKinsey report, companies in highly regulated industries (like banking) are flocking to public cloud platforms four times faster than companies in more lightly regulated industries. In other words, they rely more on security conscious cloud giants like Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure to manage their critical data and infrastructure. That's a good sign, but it's not enough. The gap between what companies are actually spending and what they should be spending will have to close (at least partially) over time. Here are two top cybersecurity providers that could benefit the most if that happens. There's a growing need for full-stack cybersecurity solutions. Technology is transforming how we do business, particularly how we work, with remote employment more common than ever. Companies need end-to-end protection, from networks right down to the endpoint devices used by employees. CrowdStrike (CRWD 1.82%) is that solution for 23,019 customers, and it's one of the fastest-growing providers in the industry. According to the company, 90% of successful cyberattacks and 70% of successful data breaches originate at the endpoint -- whether through an employee's emails, messaging platforms, phone calls, identity credentials, or even online purchases. It's no surprise, then, that CrowdStrike is focused intently on that cybersecurity segment, and it's a recognized leader by the International Data Corporation and Gartner (NYSE: IT). Artificial intelligence (AI) is the secret sauce behind CrowdStrike's success. Its models are fed 2 trillion events per day, leading to rapid improvement that scales as the company acquires more customers (more users equal more data). AI is the key to automated security, faster response times, and proactive threat hunting, which seeks out attackers before they find an opportunity to breach. The average corporate employee is neither a cyber expert nor has time to actively manage endpoint threats, so cybersecurity software must do the heavy lifting. CrowdStrike's growth has been mind-boggling. It generated $119 million in revenue in fiscal 2018, and by fiscal 2023, that number had grown 20-fold to over $2.2 billion. That's a compound annual growth rate of 80% over the five-year period. Large, complex organizations are flocking to the company for protection. It now has 3,553 customers spending between $100,000 and $1 million per year, up from just 262 customers five years ago, highlighting the rapidly growing need for advanced security tools. And there's more good news for investors. Amid the broader sell-off in the technology sector, CrowdStrike stock is down 55% from its all-time high. Given the company's leadership position and its growth, this could be a great opportunity to buy in at a discount for the long term. Tenable (TENB 0.19%) often flies under the radar in the investment world; the company is valued at just $5 billion (compared to CrowdStrike's $30 billion). But it has a leadership position in the cybersecurity industry's vulnerability management and threat detection segments. Tenable protects over 40,000 organizations globally, and its flagship Nessus platform is ranked No. 1 in accuracy, adoption, and coverage. It protects against over 75,000 common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs) -- topping all its competitors -- and it does so with the industry's lowest rate of false positives. But while Nessus is a broad vulnerability management tool, Tenable also offers a portfolio of industry specific solutions, whether a customer is in automotive manufacturing, financial services, logistics, or even the government. See, as more day-to-day operations are shifted online, companies find themselves with a growing attack surface and threats they've never faced before. Advanced vulnerability management pays for itself -- a car manufacturer, for example, can lose $22,000 for every minute of unplanned downtime, and 82% of them have reported four hours or more of unplanned downtime over a 12-month period. It's little wonder Tenable is experiencing strong growth in its top-spending customer cohort. At the end of 2022, it had 1,420 customers spending at least $100,000 annually, up 30% compared to 2021. Tenable generated $683.2 million in revenue during 2022, exceeding the midpoint of its initial guidance of $666 million. Considering the broader economy was deteriorating last year, with many tech companies laying off workers and slashing their forecasts, Tenable's ability to surpass its guidance speaks volumes of the demand for advanced cybersecurity tools. If the $1.8 trillion gap in the industry does close, this company could be set for a juicy windfall.

Learn More If you've ever been inclined to pop a Tylenol or use a Band-Aid, you've used Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ -0.54%) products. There's a good chance that you use more than one of them every day. But there's a lot more to the company than its consumer health goods, and it has quite a lot to offer for investors of all stripes. Still, J&J isn't the perfect investment. Smart investors should understand that there are three things in particular that are critical to know about this stock before buying shares. Let's take a look at each. Even the best companies get into legal trouble sometimes. When trouble crops up, watch the situation closely to see if it reveals some sort of enduring mismanagement or serious wrongdoing that might warrant a reassessment of the stock and its worthiness to remain in a portfolio.  Johnson & Johnson faces significant possibility of damages from billion-dollar-plus class-action lawsuits brought by those claiming to be harmed by its talcum powder, which was shown to be contaminated for several years with cancer-causing asbestos despite the company's denials. In early 2021, J&J set aside $3.9 billion to cover its legal costs related to these lawsuits. Unfortunately, the actual costs will ultimately prove to be higher, as at least 38,000 people are now involved in these years-long lawsuits. In an effort to get out of paying some of the settlements, J&J attempted to transfer the liability for the settlements to a shell company in late 2021 that then filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The idea was that the shell company would use the bankruptcy to better manage the costs that would arise and to protect J&J shareholders from the brunt of the damages. Federal courts denied this effort in early 2023. On April 5, Johnson & Johnson announced that it reached a settlement worth $8.9 billion with its counterparties. Under the terms of the settlement, it will pay the settlement out over the next 25 years. The shell company also filed for bankruptcy protection again, so there could still be more to come with regard to this story. The terms of the settlement will result in less cash being available to use for acquisitions, paying down debt, or paying out dividends. J&J has $23.5 billion available in cash and equivalents, so it can afford to pay. But looking at the broader picture, smart investors should be asking whether it would have been cheaper, in the long run, to simply remove the asbestos contamination from its talc products when the issue was first noticed internally and brought to the attention of management, way back in 1971. Johnson & Johnson's stock price is down about 10% over the past year. Reasons for this include the above-mentioned lawsuits, the current bear market, and some uncertainty surrounding the impending spinoff of its consumer health division into a separate public entity later this year. The dip in its share price pushed its dividend yield to 2.76%, a bit above its 10-year average of 2.54%. The above-average yield might suggest a buying opportunity, but it isn't right for everyone. Canny investors will look at past performance and note that, while the stock has generated a healthy total return of 165% over the past decade, that rate falls below the S&P 500's total return of 217% over the same timeframe. A big reason for the above-mentioned spinoff J&J is working to complete is that the company's underperforming consumer division is weighing down the smaller and better-performing segments as well as J&J's largest and best-performing pharmaceutical segment. Another reason for the lag is investor perception that J&J has gotten too big to perform as well as it used to. With a top line of $94.9 billion and a bottom line of $17.9 billion in 2022, J&J needs to add billions of dollars in revenue or earnings just to generate the growth rates the market expects of growth stocks. For most businesses, adding $1 billion in earnings in a year would be a major accomplishment that'd send shares soaring. For J&J, such a gain doesn't move the growth needle like it used to. So don't buy it just because its shares are cheap, as your money would probably grow faster in an index fund. Johnson & Johnson makes the majority of its revenue from its pharmaceutical segment, which also happens to be highly regulated. These regulations -- and changes to them -- can make a big difference in terms of J&J's ability to generate profits. Unfortunately, key regulations recently changed. As part of the Inflation Reduction Act, the Centers for Medicare Services now have the ability to levy a fine against companies that hike the prices of their drugs faster than the rate of inflation. J&J's competitors like AbbVie have already been notified that their price hikes will lead to penalties at some point in the next few years. More importantly, the company will no longer have the option of raising its drug prices annually beyond a certain point without the potential for a penalty.  The rule changes may not be as concerning for its medicines approaching the loss of their exclusivity protections. But for newer medicines, especially expensive ones like those in its oncology portfolio, the impact over the life of a drug patent could be significant.

Dylan Lewis: Today, we learn the Texas Two-Step. Motley Fool Money starts now. [music] I'm Dylan Lewis, sitting in for Chris Hill, and I'm joined by Tim Beyers. Tim, scale: caffeinated to very caffeinated. How are we doing today? Tim Beyers: We're fully caffeinated, Dylan, ready to go. Let's do it. Dylan Lewis: I'm excited that you're fully caffeinated, because we are going into the often obtuse world of corporate settlements. We have a couple of pieces of news related to that, and I thought it'd be interesting to dive into it. The first is Johnson & Johnson is proposing a $9 billion settlement to thousands who sued the company, claiming its talc products caused cancer. If this deal is approved, it would be one of the largest consumer liability settlements of all time. Notably, it is a sizable jump from the $2 billion that the company had previously booked related to those claims in 2021. Tim, as I see it, that seems quite intentional. It looks like Johnson & Johnson is trying to do a little bit of a maneuver here, and if you pay attention to the bankruptcy world and the corporate bankruptcy world, you'll know it as the Texas Two-Step. Looking to use bankruptcy law to transfer this talc case liability to a subsidiary, which would then file for bankruptcy and disburse money to those affected through the bankruptcy process. J&J would fund the payouts, but it would cap the long-term liability and the cost for Johnson & Johnson. Do I have that right? Tim Beyers: I think you're right in the ballpark here. Let's be clear. The court already saw this and said, "Time out, wait a minute here. You don't just get rid of this and just dismiss it." The company did propose a bankruptcy prior under the LTL subsidiary that you're talking about. This was created in 2021, and a federal appeals court said, "No, you don't get to do this. LTL does not get to qualify for protections of the bankruptcy court." So this became a thing that J&J had to go back to the drawing board. They literally did try this once and say, "Hey, we have this subsidiary, we're going to file bankruptcy." The appellate court said, "No, you don't get to just get rid of this." Now what we're seeing is a revised version of this that roughly more than 60,000 claimants here. This is a class action lawsuit, and so there's a lot of people with claims who are now backing this and saying, this is a better settlement. Now, we're going back to the bankruptcy court. Now, LTL will go into bankruptcy and say, "Look, here's what we're going to do. We have the backing of a bunch of claimants here, and our total payout will be roughly the present value of that will be $8.9 billion. We already settled a 2018 claim for $2.1 billion. Here's an additional 6.9, roughly $7 billion, and let's get this off the books." Now to be fair, LTL, which will be a subsidiary and will have its own operations here, and J&J will deal with this differently, and there will still be costs associated to both. It doesn't get immediately rid of all of it. But what it does do, I think the language that you used that's most important there, Dylan, is capping the liabilities. It settles the major claims so that we don't have a bunch of new lawsuits heaped upon J&J or LTL. We start settling out the things that have been agreed upon, and then we move on from there. It's a platform from which J&J gets to move on. I would argue, some really damaging litigation both from a human perspective -- a lot of cancer patients here is a lot of human tragedy here that no amount of money can make up for. But also some real damage to its reputation, because this has been going on for a long time. Actually settling this -- not admitting any wrongdoing, but saying, here's a thing that we want to make sure we get behind us, and claimants who are saying we deserve some compensation here, and they're getting that. You hope calling it a win-win doesn't feel right considering the scale of the tragedy that, because cancer is never great under any circumstances, so win-win feels wrong to say. But getting to a point where there's an agreement and hope that agreement can satisfy some people who have legitimate claims. Dylan Lewis: You talked about this being a platform for J&J to move on, and there is the liability element of the talcum powder, and then there's the corporate direction of J&J overall. This is a business that is really trying to focus on its pharmaceutical and its medical device units and is looking to take a lot of the consumer brands that I think we're very familiar with from this company and move it to another business, a self-contained business that will have its next chapter. Do you see this as another piece of that path for them? Tim Beyers: It sure seems like it. LTL is going to take essentially the consumer health unit. I don't know if it's specifically LTL. It's hard to tell from the reading of the filings here. What we do know is that J&J will separate into a separate unit. The separate unit will be called Kenview, and that's going to take on the new version of Johnson's baby powder, which I believe now, instead of talcum powder, will be using things like cornstarch powder. And then Tylenol. That becomes a stand-alone company. Then you have Johnson & Johnson, which is the much bigger company that will focus on things like medical devices and pharmaceuticals. Let's remember that Johnson & Johnson was one of the big providers of COVID vaccines not that long ago, Dylan. This is still a big pharmaceutical company that does make medical devices. It's known for things like Tylenol, but there's a lot more to it. These two separate, and it does appear when we look at the market action around this settlement or this organization plan, this bankruptcy plan, that there may be some investors who are looking at this and saying, you know what, if I buy J&J now, not only am I getting the settlement, but I might be getting two companies. At what point, how does this Kenview spinoff occur? Will it become a public company, will I get shares in a new public company called Kenview? There's a lot to be determined here, Dylan, but there is potential for value to be created out of this settlement. Dylan Lewis: Speaking of settlements, we also have settlement talk in the gaming space today. The U.S. Department of Justice is taking a look at Activision Blizzard's competitive balanced tax in its esports leagues. Tim, this is a story that developed pretty quickly. We saw a claim earlier this week, and then I believe yesterday or earlier today, we saw that the DOJ was already reviewing a proposal from Activision Blizzard related to the claim. Tim Beyers: Right, yeah. It was within like three or four hours. I mean, it was astonishing. This might be a little bit of a salty take here, Dylan. I feel like the Justice Department is maybe...overstepping feels wrong to say. But here's what's going on, this idea of a competitive balanced tax. Activision Blizzard essentially assigned to these esports teams. They have this esports leagues. The competitive balance tax idea is that you don't want a team that is essentially paying an extraordinary amount of money for a ringer and say like leagues that have to do with games like Call of Duty or Overwatch. The notion is that we want a league of teams that are pretty evenly matched, and so this is going to be fun to watch. It's not like one team is going to come in, pays all the ringers, blows everybody else away, and now this is like it's a rigged game. The idea of a competitive balance tax, honestly, Dylan, kind of makes sense to me, because in a league, I mean, we've seen this in American sports. We even see it in European sports. In the NFL, for example, we have a thing called a salary cap. Does the competitive balance tax sound all that different from a salary cap? I mean, I'm sure, functionally, it is, and because we're talking about a business, and a business that is actually getting revenue, and shareholders presumably get a claim on profits from that revenue, you can't use the same governing dynamics of a league. And yet you want the league to be competitive. In a way, I feel like this is a nonsense claim from the Justice Department. So settling it quickly feels right to me, Dylan. Dylan Lewis: I was going to ask, Tim, if this is just part of the path from esports being gaming to becoming sports and sports leagues in the way we think about it in the conventional sense, because we do have this kind of mechanisms in a lot of the major sports. I guess maybe some of the difference there is we have players' unions and collective bargaining that plays into some of that, and there's probably a little bit of maturation that just needs to happen for esports to catch up to that environment. Tim Beyers: That's probably right. As part of the reporting on this, Activision Blizzard has been very clear that there really hasn't been an application of the competitive balanced tax. There's been no impact on player salaries. We haven't suppressed player salaries in order to rig the game in the way that we want it, which is the argument of the Justice Department. The Activision Blizzard is saying that just hasn't happened. In a way, the Justice Department might be jumping the gun here to prevent something that hasn't happened. But yeah, you make a good argument here, Dylan, that we're talking about the idea of competitive dynamics and ensuring competitive dynamics in a nascent league that still has a lot to mature, develop, like we haven't seen any of this yet because esports are so new and esports leagues are so new. But there's an argument to be made if you are the Justice Department to say like, "Hey, look, no matter how you structure an esports league, you can't make it where players don't get to benefit or reap the rewards of providing value to shareholders." And in that sense, I agree. But at the same token, I disagree that you have to impose some Draconian rules before. We don't even know what the market dynamics of esports are yet. Dylan Lewis: The thing I want to leave folks with here, Tim, is we had a pretty clear sense of consequence with the J&J story. There's dollar figure that's being talked about. Tim Beyers: Right. Dylan Lewis: With this Activision story, I'm sure there are Activision shareholders that weren't even aware of this or maybe it's flying under the radar. Is this a big deal for Activision? Is this a big deal for esports? Both? Neither? Tim Beyers: It's too early to say, but it does remove a blocker, doesn't it? In that sense, removing any blocker hopefully greases the skids to completion of the acquisition we've all been waiting for. We really want this acquisition to go through with Microsoft. Anything that gets out of the way of that is a good thing, but it's probably too early to know just what happens here. I think esports are so new, and what kind of dynamics they have, like the economics of an esports league and how it works with other professional sports leagues, it's just too new. How it contributes to Activision's overall business, it's just too new. But it does have the potential to be massive. I myself am shocked by how compelling I have found it to watch esports competition. This is real, Dylan. I actually did watch the FIFA ePremier League Final Tournament, and I was shocked by how compelling I thought that it was. There's definitely something here. Dylan Lewis: I bet it wasn't more compelling than watching Crystal Palace, though. Tim Beyers: Well, it was digital Crystal Palace, and they lost. Yes, not as compelling because they lost. Dylan Lewis: Tim, thanks so much for joining me as always. [music] Tim Beyers: Thanks, Dylan. Dylan Lewis: Pet retailer and pandemic-era darling Chewy lost 250,000 customers in the latest quarter. Is this a speed bump or a long-term problem? Ricky Mulvey caught up with Motley Fool Senior Analyst Emily Flippen to take a look at the online pet retailer. Ricky Mulvey: The first step in Peter Lynch investing style is looking around you. There are probably a lot of Chewy boxes in your apartment complex, your neighborhood, or in your home. But the online pet retailer is facing some more headwinds. Joining us now, Emily Flippen and Chewy stakeholders Xiaobao and Stevie. Emily, you talked about Chewy on the show a couple of weeks ago, and I got the vibe that you had more to say. Emily Flippen: I certainly did. If you let me go on about Chewy and my cat, Xiaobao, go on about Chewy, we will be here forever, and that's because it's one of those few businesses that I think does benefit from being consumer facing. As you mentioned, everybody knows what Chewy is because their boxes are ubiquitous, at least across the United States right now. But also because it's a relatively easy-to-understand business that adapts the Peter Lynch style of investing, where you can easily wrap your head around it. And also it's extremely straightforward in terms of their growth strategy. All they need to do is expand their relationship with customers, acquire new customers, and sell more things for this investment to pay off. Ricky Mulvey: Let's start with the bad news, though. Chewy's active customer base dropped by about 250,000 accounts in its latest quarter, now stands at about 20 million customer accounts. How concerned are you about this? How concerned should long-term investors be? Emily Flippen: Yeah. Like I just mentioned, one of the key factors in their growth plan is to acquire new customers, and anytime you see active customers dropping quarter over quarter -- or year over year, in this case -- it can be concerning. That's certainly what the market was reacting to in Chewy's most recent quarter. But I don't think it's a reason for investors to be overly concerned, because we did expect some level of churn in active customers coming out of the pandemic, and they count their active customers as anybody who's made a purchase on their platform over the course of the past year. So they are still very much coming out of this massive influx of users they received during the pandemic. What's important to remember is they still have more than 20 million active customers. That's around 20%, 22% of the total number of pet households in the United States. It's a massive number of users. So when you think about how much more can Chewy grow, I've always been much more focused on them expanding their margins, so giving more profit to shareholders, increasing their relationships that they have with those active users, so finding new reasons for them to engage on the platform, purchase more things, and entering ancillary sections, so pet healthcare, pet insurance, these types of value-added services. My thesis has always been much more about acquiring value from their most loyal customers as opposed to acquiring more than a quarter of every single pet household in the United States. Ricky Mulvey: When you see that drop, do you think that's a macro problem? A lot of people got pets over the pandemic. Maybe some of those went back to shelters, unfortunately. Or do you think that's a problem with the company? Emily Flippen: I actually think it's showing up as a macro problem right now. We're seeing this headwind for the pet industry across every retailer, which is to say pet inflation has been incredibly high. People who got pets can't necessarily afford them. There has been a lot of discounting churn, these types of headwinds that have been influencing pet owners in United States. From that aspect, it's certainly a macro issue. But when you think about what the issue is, the company specifically is dealing with, they've dealt with supply chain constraints, potentially losing active customers because they haven't been able to ship things as quickly as they've planned to. Those have subsided in recent quarters, but that can still lead to, again, that churn being a year-over-year churn that can still lead to some of the decline in active customers that we've seen. I think it's mostly macro, but there are certainly some micro aspects that could be playing on here. Ricky Mulvey: I also think that it has to have some long-term tailwinds, though, not just the pandemic, but a lot of folks treating more of their pets like children and being inflation resistant, especially in a higher-income household, to get their pets the best food they can. Emily Flippen: Yeah, that's certainly the case. We've seen that time and time again, where people will be more willing to spend money on their pets than they will on themselves. When you see pet food inflation up 15%, people are still buying their pets pet food and fancy pet food. They're still spending more money on their pet food, even though they may be discounting the type and quality of the food that they're consuming on their own. It's the pet humanization trend that we've heard and seen so much of, and it's especially prevalent among Chewy's younger users. That's still very much a tailwind. The fact that prices have increased so much, they've been able to raise prices on their platform. That's also been a margin tailwind for Chewy. With all the headwinds that are existing in the world right now, certainly, those tailwinds are benefiting Chewy as well. Ricky Mulvey: Chewy's leadership very much enjoys talking about international growth plans, their pet insurance program, the pet pharmacy. Their Autoship revenue, automatically shipping folks things like pet food, is more than 70% of the total sales. Why is this such a big part of Chewy's business? And is this something that you'd like to see the leadership spending more attention on? Emily Flippen: Yeah, so let's explain why this metric is important for investors. We talked about the decline in active customers. That's concerning. But when you see a rise in Autoship sales, rising to over 73% in the most recent quarter, that says the customers they're losing are not the same customers that have the deepest relationship with Chewy. The same is true for their net sales per active customer, which has continued to rise more than 15% in the most recent quarter. Despite the fact that they're losing users year over year, the users that they're retaining are spending more time and money on the platform, and Autoship sales are a function of that. For investors, they also provide a really nice level of visibility into Chewy's revenue stream. Because the perception is, is that Autoship sales, despite the fact they can be canceled -- everybody knows this, we've all canceled Autoship -- but they provide some type of recurring revenue for the business. In general, people aren't going in and changing their Autoship every single week or every single month. That provides visibility, it provides stability, and more importantly, it provides a sign that the customers that Chewy is engaging the most with are still very loyal, still spending a lot of time and money on the platform itself despite the decline. Ricky Mulvey: What's the customer's reason for going to Autoship on that? Is it predictability, or are you getting a better deal on pet food? Emily Flippen: There's some deal. Chewy offers, I believe is like a 5% discount on Autoship. Automatically, you know, every single month, my cat will eat three cans of this type of Fancy Feast, which Xiaobao is very particular about the food he eats. I had to Autoship very particular things. I know what he likes and I know he eats it on a consistent basis. I feed him on a consistent basis. It just makes sense to have that Autoship setup. If you read through Chewy's most recent annual report, they actually show that more than 58% of pet households get the majority of their food through this Autoship relationships. This is all to say that people like the predictability that comes with ordering Autoship. I think there's an element of, I save a little bit of money when I do that, but at the same time, I don't have to be constantly thinking about what food did Xiaobao want to eat this week? I know it's coming to me automatically. Ricky Mulvey: It's nice when an investing thesis is that cats are picky. Chewy's got a pet insurance program, Chewy Health. It also operates the largest pet pharmacy in United States. Unfortunately, this does bring to mind when Amazon tried to disrupt healthcare with health insurance and operating a pharmacy. Is this a different situation? Emily Flippen: I think that's a totally fair comparison, and I will say that I do think it's a different situation. People are already accustomed to combining pet healthcare with pet food and pet retailers. Think about the relationship that Banfield Pet Hospitals had with PetSmart. That's been a wildly successful investment for PetSmart. The exposure to pet health is something that I think all consumers are already aware of. If you go onto Chewy's healthcare offerings right now, you can get on there and order pet healthcare the same way you can order your pet food, the medicine and drugs and the fact that they have a relationship with insurance providers as well. They have underwriting services provided by companies like Trupanion means that it simplifies the process of, I go to the vet, I need a prescription for my pet. I can get it paid for through my insurance that's managed by Chewy, delivered by Chewy Health. It's kind of a symbiotic relationship. I think consumers are just more willing to approach that relationship with Chewy. I don't normally go onto Amazon to seek out healthcare. That was a harder uphill battle for Amazon to fight. Ricky Mulvey: One major growth plan, though, is going international. I'm going to quote from CEO Sumit Singh in the latest earnings call. "We plan and expect to bring all components of our value proposition to the international market, and at the same time, we're going to be very actively listening to the voice of the customer, designing our launch, working backward from that so there is no dissonance in the way we show up in the cultural nuance as Chewy brand enters the international market." What's your reaction? Emily Flippen: I can't have a reaction because that says nothing. That tells investors absolutely nothing. You can go back, rewind, listen to Ricky read that again. Because that tells investors virtually nothing other than, "Hey, we're interested in expanding internationally, and we're going to be conscious about the way that we do it." It's OK, but conscious how? They've given investors effectively no information about how they plan on entering international market. Which international markets they're planning on entering? If they're going to use third-party logistics or distribution systems, if they're going to build out their own? As an investor in Chewy, if anybody who's listened to the Motley Fool Money radio show when we talked about this previously, this was a big pause for me, because it's a massive change in strategy for the business. We just started to see them get some operating leverage here in United States. They save a lot of money by not having to spend a lot in marketing to acquire customers here in the U.S. Great brand reputation. "Why now?" became the question of why did Chewy decide to seek out international expansion the same quarter that they're announcing this decline in active customer growth? There's a fear among investors, myself included, that this decision was made not because they see a massive opportunity that they think can be really profitable but because they see an opportunity to expand users once again and assuage investors' fears that they are a declining business. I would much rather have a business that is mildly declining in active users but still growing relationships with the most loyal users, producing more profit, expanding margins, and dominating the market here in the United States rather than spending a lot of time, money, and effort trying to expand internationally in markets that may already be saturated. So I'm a little bit concerned. I don't like the lack of color that investors have about international expansion, but I'm doing my best to be patient -- it's a hard thing for me to do -- and wait for management to give us some more information over the coming quarters. Ricky Mulvey: They seem to be playing a 2021 game in 2023. Emily Flippen: Exactly. Ricky Mulvey: Let's say you had a few minutes with CEO Sumit Singh. What are you pitching him as another growth driver? Is there maybe try this idea instead right now? Emily Flippen: Yeah, I love that. There's a lot of things that I would rather see right now than them expanding internationally. The first thing I'd say is, you don't need another growth driver. Your core business is a growth driver right now. Net sales grew 13% over the most recent quarter. That's incredible for a company of Chewy's size. I would be hyper focused on growing the bottom line just as quickly. I would be focused on, let's continue the leverage that we've already developed in United States, monetizing the distribution better than we have. We've already spent a lot of capital, tons of money expanding here. Let's see the profits at that. Let's understand the customers a bit more. And now let's think about international expansion. Now let's talk about market research. Which markets are we entering? What can we leverage there to maintain our margin profile but also expanding internationally? I dislike this so much that I think I would rather have heard Chewy's leadership come out and say, we're going to build physical retail Chewy stores. We're going to build out physical stores to sell pet food in the United States rather than expanding internationally. I think that would be less of a money suck than this potential international expansion. Ricky Mulvey: You're going to put a lot of management consultants out of business if they follow that advice. With these words and strategic questions, though, are you still holding onto your Chewy stock? I'm a shareholder. I'm still holding it. Emily Flippen: Yeah, look, as negative as I've been in the second half of this conversation, I'm still a Chewy shareholder. I'm still buying from Chewy. I'm still planning on holding Chewy's shares. I think it's important to be really critical of the companies that we own, to always be evaluating whether or not they're right for our portfolios, whether or not their strategy has broken our thesis. At this point, I don't have enough information to determine whether or not I think this is going to absolutely destroy Chewy's focus. If they pull a Wayfair and spend a lot of money trying to expand in Europe, I would consider that potentially a reason to be selling the stock right now. But I don't see that as the case at the moment. Until I see that as the case, then I'm continuing to hold my shares, take the long-term approach here, and going to trust that management is going to do what they do best, which is be measured, calculated, and very conscious in their approach. To give Sumit Singh some credit here, when they expanded Chewy, when they went public, they were a very metrics-focused business. They had a deep understanding of the lifetime value of their customer and their acquisition cost. If they take that same approach to international expansion, then this could be really successful. I'm hesitant, but I'm still a shareholder, still holding, still following this company. Ricky Mulvey: Still hanging on. Emily Flippen, appreciate your time as always.

JPM (2023-04-10 21:44:44): Sign up for MarketBeat All Access to gain access to MarketBeat's full suite of research tools:  While First Republic Bank NYSE: FRC) remains too risky for average investors, it is an interesting speculative play. Given the suitable catalysts, the company has value despite its risk and could rebound. Among the potential catalysts are the company’s Q1 earnings which will be released on April 14. The analysts aren’t expecting much from the results, a 33% decline in revenue and a 76% decline in earnings, but the new consensus targets are questionable. Given the uncertainty surrounding the bank's business and health, there is a significant chance for over or underperformance. Ironically, the bank was being sized up as a long-term winner before the bank run, which caused the collapse.  The trend in analysts' sentiment and the current consensus ratings are interesting. The 1st thing to note is that FRC sentiment and price target trended higher before the collapse. The sentiment had firmed to a Moderate Buy from Hold with a high price target well above $200. That was driven by an improving growth outlook and attractive valuation, but that has changed. The analysts have been lowering their ratings and price targets, price targets dramatically, but they are still holding on to the stock. The new consensus is a firm Hold, and no sell ratings are showing up on Marketbeat.com’s tracking page this year or last, which is a sign of conviction. Some market participants think this stock is a sell, but no Wall Street analysts have joined the bear camp.  The price target is even more interesting for bullish speculators. It has come down more than 30% since the bank run but still assumes the stock is worth more than $100 and could advance nearly 1,000%. The consensus fell sharply following the collapse but has held steady since then. Wells Fargo set the latest new target on April 5th, the new low at $25. This indicates the actual consensus is below $139 and even $100 (when filtering out pre-collapse targets), but even $25 implies nearly 70% of upside is possible.  Yet the short interest is another indication the market isn’t as bearish on this stock as it might be. The short interest surged 80% following the collapse but only about 5% of the shares. Since then, the shorts have covered, and there has been some rotation, but interest is steady near 5% as of the last report. That may change if more bad news is released, but it appears the bank has been stabilized.   Regulators have urged the banking industry to consolidate, the larger, more stable bangs to buy out the smaller, toxic regional lenders, and First Republic is in the crosshairs. It has been estimated a takeover could happen before the following earnings report, but who might be a buyer? So far, the bank has accepted more than $30 billion in aid from a consortium of banks, including JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM), Citigroup (NYSE: C) and Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC). While a single buyer may present itself, it is more likely the bank will be split into segments and sold to whichever banks want them. The question is, what is the value of this company, and at what price will it sell?  The chart of FRC price action is ugly. Taken at face value, the downtrend appears to be gaining momentum and is set up for a much larger fall. The candles smack of a Bearish Flag Pattern that, if confirmed, could lead the stock down to $0 or close to it. The caveat is that this market is incredibly oversold and may have overextended to the point a rebound is inevitable. In that light, this market may move lower, and it may move higher depending on the next news that comes out.

Learn More Johnson & Johnson (JNJ -0.54%) has been dealing with tens of thousands of lawsuits related to its talc products, which plaintiffs allege gave them cancer. There is nothing unusual about a company the size of Johnson & Johnson dealing with some legal issues. But the sheer number and nature of the company's lawsuits, combined with some plaintiffs accusing the drugmaker of knowing the dangers associated with its talc products but ignoring them to make a buck, have been damaging to the company's image. Fortunately, Johnson & Johnson seems to be moving closer to putting this major risk in the rearview mirror. Let's discuss what that could mean for investors. On April 4, Johnson & Johnson announced that its subsidiary, LTL Management, was offering $8.9 billion to settle all lawsuits related to its talc products. That's significantly more than the $2 billion the company had previously offered. The $8.9 billion will be payable over 25 years and, as Johnson & Johnson emphasized, will not be an admission of wrongdoing. The company also says that more than 60,000 concerned parties are backing the settlement under these terms. Settling would let the pharmaceutical giant avoid spending more time and money defending itself in court and potentially being declared responsible for the damage its talc products have allegedly caused. And although $8.9 billion sounds like a lot of money, in the grand scheme of things, it isn't, not for a company of Johnson & Johnson's size. Last year, the drugmaker had revenue of $94.9 billion, a 1.3% increase year over year. Johnson & Johnson's net profit declined by 14.1% for the year to $17.9 billion. So the $8.9 billion for this settlement would represent just under 50% of the net income Johnson & Johnson reported last year. Of course, it would be better for shareholders if the company didn't have to pay this amount at all, but it also would not be a particularly damaging settlement amount. Although this proposed settlement is good news for Johnson & Johnson, there are many reasons to consider investing in the company regardless of these new developments. Johnson & Johnson is a Dividend King. It is on a fantastic run of 60 consecutive years of dividend increases. And the company's business is strong enough to sustain many more hikes, even with the talc-related lawsuits it is facing. Johnson & Johnson's long list of products includes more than a dozen blockbuster medicines that generate over $1 billion in annual sales. The company's pipeline boasts 109 programs that routinely lead to new approvals and indications. The drugmaker also has a medical device business that could grab onto the exciting and fast-growing robotic-assisted surgery market thanks to its Ottava robot system. Johnson & Johnson is spinning off its consumer health unit, a transaction that will decrease diversification but boost revenue growth. Despite all this, Johnson & Johnson's stock had struggled, partly due to issues related to the talc lawsuits. Maybe that's why its shares climbed once the company announced the $8.9 billion settlement, though they still are down about 10% in the past year. Johnson & Johnson could remain vulnerable in the short run, with a still-challenging economic environment that might weigh on the company's financial results the way it did last year (for example, currency exchange rate fluctuations took a bite out of Johnson & Johnson's revenue growth). But for long-term investors, now is an excellent time to initiate a position in Johnson & Johnson. The company is moving to put one of its biggest risks -- which was damaging to its image -- to bed thanks to this settlement. The spin off its consumer health unit will have a positive affect on the business's growth rate, and the economy will recover eventually. That will lead to stronger top- and bottom-line growth, higher payouts, and Johnson & Johnson remaining a leader in healthcare for years to come. Investors should stay put with this pharmaceutical stock. Prosper Junior Bakiny has positions in Johnson & Johnson. The Motley Fool recommends Johnson & Johnson.

Learn More A stock market sell-off in 2022 caused Apple's (AAPL -0.98%) stock to fall 27% throughout the year. The tumble was driven mainly by macroeconomic headwinds, which reduced consumer spending and led tech stocks to fall out of favor with Wall Street.  The market has enjoyed a surge in 2023, with Apple shares up 24% year to date. However, recent reports that the company's personal computing sales are falling could prompt a short-term dip, and make it an excellent time to buy.  Here's why Apple's stock is a screaming buy after a sell-off.  The PC market experienced steep declines in 2022, hurting companies across the industry. With inflation showing signs of easing in recent months, many analysts have thought the market would begin recovering this year. However, an IDC report published on April 9 revealed that PC sales continued to slip in the first quarter of 2023, with shipments falling 29% year over year. What's more, while Apple's rivals Lenovo, HP Inc., Dell, and ASUS experienced PC shipments declines between 24.2% and 30.3%, the iPhone company's shipments decreased over 40%. The report led Apple shares to begin trending down, falling around 2% in the first few hours of the market's opening on April 10. While a stumble in PCs is concerning for Apple's Mac segment, it isn't particularly damning for the company's long-term success. The company's home-grown computer chips, dubbed Apple Silicon, perform far better than the competition. In battery life alone, Apple's M2 chip provided between 50% and over 100% more battery life than competing versions from Dell and Asus. The company's edge primarily stems from the complete control it has over its chip production, while its rivals rely on suppliers such as Intel and AMD. As a result, Apple's outperforming chips and Macs will likely allow it to surpass its rivals over the long term. In the meantime, Apple's revenue diversification makes it well-equipped to sustain its business until market headwinds subside. In fiscal 2022, the company's Mac business was responsible for about 10% of all revenue, being the fourth-largest segment. Moreover, reductions in Mac shipments don't necessarily mean a massive drop in revenue. The company charges a premium for its brand and quality products, making it more protected against market challenges than its peers. In January 2023, Apple launched the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models, which are larger, more powerful, and more expensive than their 2022 predecessor. The same month also saw the tech giant release beefier versions of its desktop line of Mac Minis, which now includes a $1,299 version, when the most expensive base model was previously $899. Apple's Mac segment is an essential part of its business model. However, with solid growth still coming from its larger segments, such as digital services, it's worth buying a dip in its stock price, as PC market declines won't last forever.  Apple is home to a potent brand that has led it to gain leading market shares in smartphones, tablets, smartwatches, and headphones. The company's success has allowed it to enjoy stock growth of 278% over the last five years and achieve the largest market cap in the world. Consequently, a short-term dip in its stock is the time to buy. Investing mogul Warren Buffett had a similar view in 2022, with his holding company Berkshire Hathaway increasing its stake in Apple by 4% in Q1 and Q2 2022 amid a drop in its stock price. The iPhone company is by far Berkshire's biggest holding, with its immense brand loyalty and popular products making it a consistently growing investment.  Apple shares are currently down 5% for the year, but that figure could grow over the next few days as news about the company's decline in Mac shipments continues to spread. If that's the case, the company's stock will be a screaming buy. However, even if it doesn't see a substantial dip, Apple remains a stock you can buy and hold indefinitely as it gradually grows.  Dani Cook has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Advanced Micro Devices, Apple, Berkshire Hathaway, and HP. The Motley Fool recommends Intel and recommends the following options: long January 2023 $57.50 calls on Intel and long January 2025 $45 calls on Intel.

AAPL (2023-04-13 19:11:46): Sign up for MarketBeat All Access to gain access to MarketBeat's full suite of research tools:  Economic pendulums swing from expansion to contraction and vice versa as cycles take over their natural processes. Whenever the pendulum swings too fast or too far one way, physics (and economics) dictate that it must, after that, face a similar and opposite swing in the opposite direction. The semiconductor industry saw a definite swing to extreme demand, record shortages, and the inability to meet increasing demand. A seemingly negative statistic quickly takes the spotlight when investors look at the FED capacity utilization reports for the past two quarters. Computer and electronic equipment segments saw readings decline from 70.8% utilization (where a 75-80% reading is considered healthy) down to 65.5% in February of 2023, posing a threat of continued declines when March's statistics are reported. A decline in capacity utilization comes from elevated inventory levels across the industry and falling demand from various electronics markets, namely the personal computer space.  Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) reported a 40.5% decline in personal computer shipments in the first quarter of 2023, accruing to a total shipment decline of 29% across the personal computer industry. The dire slowdown in personal computer sales and subsequent orders is further accentuated in practices by companies like HP (NYSE: HPQ) and Lenovo Group (OTCMKTS: LNVGY) applying discounts to their laptops and other personal computers within their websites. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) had been a Warren Buffett favorite before the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the oracle of Omaha has openly expressed that there are now greener pastures in other markets. Buffett has recently expressed concern regarding geopolitical risks between China and Taiwan, as the mainland giant has been flexing its military muscles with repeated drills around the smaller island. This behavior by Chinese officials has created tension and growing concerns regarding a possible invasion and more significant conflict. Buffett has reportedly reduced his stake in Taiwan Semiconductor by nearly USD 4 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022, expressing to the Nikkei Newspaper that the foundry giant is still well run but that his holding company had more attractive markets in which to deploy its capital. "Better markets" were located in Japan as Buffett has invested in Japanese trading houses, with stakes up to 7.4% ownership in each, making diversification in food and energy an attractive bet.  Meanwhile, Taiwan Semiconductor reported its first quarter sales data (month by month), with a disappointing tone to investors finding their footing within the personal computer waters. January and February both showcased reasonable sales growth rates, posting 16.2% and 11.1% respectively; however, the beat of the drum seemed to pivot in March as the company reported -15.4% contraction in sales making this the second consecutive quarter of missed sales expectations.  Not only are sales delivering a disappointing quarter for Taiwan Semiconductor investors, but management has also guided to contracting margins across the board. For example, the fourth quarter of 2022 saw gross margins of 62.2% and operating margins of 52%; investors can now expect (aside from a revenue decline) gross margins closer to 53.5% and operating margins around 1,100 basis points lower than the previous quarter, translating to 41.5%. Perhaps this has been one of the factors, adding to growing geopolitical risk concerns, for Buffett to consider reducing his position in the global foundry giant. Some investors may be willing to take a second, or even third, look at the Taiwan conglomerate after noticing a reported 2022 return on equity of 39.8%. In contrast, the average American business struggles to top 10-12%. Despite all the excitement around this well-run high-quality business operating in one of the fastest-growing industries, analyst targets give investors a warning sign into what may come later this year by pointing to the stock currently trading around fair value, as seen in their negligible 1.4% upside. An ensuing global economic slowdown, seen mainly in the United States Manufacturing PMI index, which is below 50% (anything below 50% signals economic contraction) for five consecutive months. Given that Taiwan Semiconductor relies on iPhones and other personal electronics, which derive most of their revenue from the American consumer, this contraction in economic activity may fuel a possible decline in the stock before it comes into favor again. TSM stock may be brought back to attractive support ranges, with the first and most proximate being $72-$76 and a secondary level being within $58-$62, implying significant Fibonacci retracement levels and weekly RSI 'oversold' areas. Therefore, investors would be best served by waiting for capacity utilization rebounds in the personal electronics space and a revival of sales and orders from Apple and other personal computer giants, all to be able to pick TSM stock at more favorable yields.   Before you consider Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, you'll want to hear this.

Learn More Johnson & Johnson (JNJ -0.54%) is making another effort to resolve the lawsuits related to its talc baby powder products. Tens of thousands of lawsuits have been filed asserting that asbestos in those talc products caused cancers among the people who used them. This time, the company is allocating billions more to address the claims than it offered in its previously rejected bid. While its new offer would be a hefty price to pay to put these issues behind it, here's why the substantially increased proposal is good for the company and its investors. In 2021, Johnson & Johnson created a new subsidiary to take on its talc business, as well as the liability for the asbestos-related lawsuits. It then attempted to put that subsidiary into bankruptcy, which would have had the effect of freezing the litigation. In January of this year, however, an appeals court judge tossed out that effort, so now Johnson & Johnson is making a second attempt to settle the cases. This time, rather than a $2 billion settlement fund, the healthcare company is proposing a settlement worth at least $8.9 billion. It's an offer that, according to the company, a majority of the plaintiffs support.  If the bankruptcy courts approve the move, it would be great news for J&J shareholders because there's a real possibility that if it winds up fighting through all of those cases in court, the healthcare company could very well end up paying more. There are over 60,000 claimants involved, and estimating the potential cost of settling those cases plus the associated legal fees would be next to impossible. Further, the number of people involved could increase. Consider that in a previous ruling, a court awarded $2.1 billion to 22 women who developed ovarian cancer as a result of using Johnson & Johnson's talc-based products. While this doesn't mean that every case would end with a similar level of payouts per plaintiff, that one involved just 22 people. Absent a settlement deal, the total liabilities Johnson & Johnson could face over the years could be vastly more than that, potentially in the hundreds of billions of dollars.  As such, the company has a huge incentive to settle the issue, especially if it's a manageable amount, as it will also help eliminate the dark cloud hanging over the business. And what makes it particularly manageable is the term of the settlement. The actual amount Johnson & Johnson proposes to settle on is $12 billion, but $8.9 billion is the present value of that settlement. That's because if the settlement deal is approved, Johnson & Johnson will be able to spread its payment out over a period of 25 years, so the total value becomes less in today's dollars. For Johnson & Johnson, that would make the settlement even easier to manage. If $12 billion in outlays  were equally spread out over 25 years, it would amount to $480 million per year. Johnson & Johnson generates well in excess of that on a yearly basis. The lowest annual free cash it has reported in the past decade has been over $13 billion -- enough to cover the entire settlement amount.  JNJ Free Cash Flow (Annual) data by YCharts. If the majority of plaintiffs is indeed in favor of this settlement offer, this is a positive development for Johnson & Johnson. However, to reach approval, the deal will need agreement from 75% of the plaintiffs. If it fails to get that many yes votes, perhaps raising the proposed payment to $20 billion or $25 billion would be enough -- and even those amounts could be manageable for the company. Either way, it appears that Johnson & Johnson is on a path that will finally put this issue behind it. As such, although the settlement isn't a done deal just yet, Johnson & Johnson does look like a safer investment than it did before this news broke. After the news of the improved offer became public, the healthcare stock jumped, but it could still climb higher. Indeed, despite that pop, the stock remains near its 52-week low. Plus, Johnson & Johnson is spinning off its troubled consumer health business this year, which should make the remaining company (which will include its pharmaceutical and medical device units) a better buy overall as those are higher-growth businesses. If you're a long-term investor, now may be an ideal time to buy shares of Johnson & Johnson as there's definitely a bit less risk today surrounding the stock.

The best ones even pay you to hold them for years via generous dividends. Three Motley Fool contributors identified their picks for dividend stocks to buy and hold for the next decade. Here's why they chose AbbVie (ABBV 0.41%), Gilead Sciences (GILD 2.22%), and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ -0.54%).  Keith Speights (AbbVie): If you only looked at what AbbVie faces over the near term, you'd likely want to avoid the stock like the plague. Sales for the company's top-selling drug, Humira, are falling like a brick with new competition from biosimilars in the U.S. market. However, I view the Humira headwinds as only a temporary storm before the calm for AbbVie. The drugmaker acknowledges that 2023 will be a challenging year. There's no way to sugarcoat losing exclusivity for a drug that generated nearly 37% of total sales last year. But the picture should begin to improve in 2024 with strong sales growth returning in 2025. AbbVie already has two worthy successors to Humira on the market -- Rinvoq and Skyrizi. The company projects peak combined sales of more than $21 billion by 2027. That's greater than Humira made at its peak. Other growth drivers for AbbVie include Botox, migraine drugs Qulipta and Ubrelvy, and antipsychotic Vraylar. In addition, the company's pipeline features several promising new programs, with cancer therapy epcoritamab and Parkinson's disease drug ABBV-951 especially standing out. In the meantime, AbbVie's dividend program gives investors a lot to like. The company is a Dividend King with 51 consecutive years of dividend increases. Its dividend yield currently tops 3.6%. David Jagielski (Gilead Sciences): If you're planning to hold a dividend stock for a decade, you should be confident in the business and its ability to grow and generate plenty of free cash. Having sufficient free cash can help sustain a dividend while also allowing a company to reinvest in its operations.  Gilead Sciences is an excellent example of a business that fits the bill. In each of the past four years, the company has generated more than $7 billion in free cash flow. Its dividend, meanwhile, costs the business about $3.7 billion -- a little over half that tally.   There's room for the company to not only fund its growth, but also raise its dividend, which Gilead has done. Its current quarterly payout of $0.75 is 32% higher than the $0.57 it was paying five years ago. That averages out to a compound annual growth rate of 5.6%. If Gilead were to continue increasing its dividend payments at that rate, it would take approximately 13 years for the dividend to double.  Thus, there's a big incentive for holding the dividend stock for the long term as its already high dividend yield of 3.6% could generate even more recurring income for your portfolio in the future. While a lot can change during that time, Gilead's HIV business gives it some valuable stability, as patients need to take HIV treatments on an ongoing basis. And Gilead recently obtained approval for a long-acting HIV treatment, Sunlenca, which only needs to be taken twice a year. It's only available for people who cannot take other HIV treatments (e.g., they are resistant to other drugs) but it can be a game changer for those patients who are eligible.  Meanwhile, Gilead is growing oncology business can also set the company up for even more growth down the road. As a case in point, sales from cancer drug Trodelvy rose 79% last year to $680 million. Gilead's business has a lot of growth potential. With its strong financials and billions in free cash flow, this stock is an income-generating investment you'll want to hang on to for the next decade. Prosper Junior Bakiny (Johnson & Johnson): There are many things for which Johnson & Johnson is known. Customers are familiar with the popular brands it offers through its consumer health division (Tylenol, Listerine, Aveeno, etc.), which it is currently spinning off. Some admire Johnson & Johnson's long history of medical innovation and solid financial results. Others are attracted to the drugmaker's run of 60 consecutive years of dividend increases, which makes the company a Dividend King. However, over the years, Johnson & Johnson's image has been tarnished by a litany of lawsuits, especially those surrounding its talcum products that allegedly caused cancer, or so the tens of thousands of plaintiffs claim. The increased legal burden Johnson & Johnson has faced is perhaps its biggest risk, with the potential to significantly harm the company's finances in the next decade and beyond. Fortunately, it looks increasingly likely that the healthcare giant will be just fine and should continue delivering solid results and dividend hikes for a while. Johnson & Johnson recently offered $8.9 billion to settle all current and future talc-related lawsuits with no admission of guilt, a settlement that would be favorable in the grand scheme of things and is being backed by many of the concerned parties.  Elsewhere, the company's business remains strong, with the split from its consumer division underway, which will lead to stronger revenue growth. J&J still has plenty of blockbuster products in its pharmaceutical portfolio. It also has a medtech segment that's an important player in cardiovascular health, robotic-assisted surgery, and more areas. The company should be more than capable of generating consistent profits, just as in the past. Johnson & Johnson's dividend yield of 2.75% is higher than the S&P 500's average of 1.74%, and its dividend track record speaks for itself. That's why it's still worth it for income-seeking investors to stick with Johnson & Johnson through the next 10 years or more despite its legal issues.  David Jagielski has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Learn More Johnson & Johnson (JNJ -0.54%) isn't exactly a controversial stock because of its reputation for stability, which it earned by being one of the largest and longest-lived healthcare businesses in the world. But with the total return of its shares reaching 160% over the last 10 years compared to the S&P 500's return of 212%, it's reasonable for investors to wonder whether the stock has in it to outperform the market -- or at least come a bit closer to market return levels -- over the next decade. So, let's examine the issue by making an argument why someone might still want to buy Johnson & Johnson stock, and then look at the opposition from the bears to get a more complete picture of what shareholders could have in store. Before we dive into the bull thesis, it's important to note that the Johnson & Johnson of the future will be different from the one of today. Before the end of the year, the company plans to spin off its consumer health division into a new business that will be called Kenvue. In 2022, that segment had $14.9 billion in revenue, which makes it significantly smaller in comparison to its sales of pharmaceuticals, which brought in $52.5 billion, and medical devices and technologies, which had $27.4 billion in sales. The consumer health segment is also the one that holds the rights to many of the brands that you're probably familiar with, like Tylenol and Aveeno. So by spinning off the segment, the new J&J will be separating itself from the long-lived brands and evergreen product lines that have delivered billions in revenue over the years, with the idea being that it can increase its pace of growth by focusing on its two remaining segments, both of which are more dynamic.  In that scenario, the bull thesis for the stock is that investors who buy it today will get shares of both of the entities created by the spinoff. In theory, that should give shareholders medium-pace growth from the pharmaceutical and medical technology company, as well as the slow-but-reliable growth from the consumer health company. And both will pay a dividend, of course. Right now, Johnson & Johnson has 109 clinical programs in its pharmaceutical pipeline, 43 of which are in late-stage trials. What's more, it could get five new indications for its medicines that are already approved in major markets like the U.S. and the E.U. In 2022, the segment grew by 6.8% on an operational basis. For reference, in 2012, it grew by exactly the same amount, also on an operational basis. So if the spinoff can sustainably juice a few more percentage points from roughly that pace of annual expansion, it will be a success, and investors will benefit over the long term. It will probably take a few years for the spinoff-driven bull thesis to prove itself, assuming the bulls are right. The only question is, can the company's plan work? The bear thesis for J&J stock is that for a business as large and as established in its markets as this company is, it probably doesn't have much to gain in efficiency from the spinoff. Plus, the spinoff creates extra expense and more risk that could disrupt an otherwise slowly growing and stable corporate giant. And even without the questionable impacts of the spinoff, bears are likely to point out that J&J's stock hasn't been a better investment than an index fund for quite some time, even when factoring in reinvestment of its dividends. Stoking the flames of the bear thesis is that management has said little about concrete plans for how the spinoff will actually benefit shareholders right out of the gate. And separating such a large segment means significantly reducing the pool of resources available to both of the new entities. While it's very unlikely that Johnson & Johnson could go under as a result, one or both of the new entities might need to take out fresh debt to pay for the transition, which would then cost shareholders in the form of interest payments that couldn't be reinvested for growth, or distributed as dividends.  So the bear thesis is largely about the heightened risk of buying J&J's shares today in light of growth that is unlikely to be rapid regardless of whatever the new businesses do. Separately from the above, there's also the issue of its ongoing legal tussle regarding its liability from its talc-based products that tens of thousands of people say gave them cancer over the last couple of decades. The company offered to settle with the plaintiffs for $8.9 billion recently. It's not too clear how the issue will be finally resolved, but it's clear that J&J will be forced to pay out billions. At the moment, the questions raised by the bear thesis are more compelling. Until management of the pharmaceutical and medical tech operation provides a more concrete plan for the use of capital after the spinoff, there isn't much point in investing in a slowly expanding business that's approaching a major fork in the road and a big and sticky legal liability.  While it's probably the case that the bulls who buy the stock will get paid a decent dividend income for many years even if the spinoff doesn't go well, J&J's minimal chances of outperforming the market make it a tough sell. The company is still probably a safer investment than most -- but before the spinoff was announced, there wasn't any need to say "probably."

Learn More Johnson & Johnson (JNJ -0.54%) is a stalwart in the healthcare industry, and it's also a rock-solid dividend investment to own. The company has been increasing its dividend payments for 60 consecutive years and has a track record few other companies can boast about. But what makes it even more impressive is the rate at which it's been raising its payouts by. One of the things income investors should pay close attention to when looking at dividend growth stocks is the rate they increase their dividend payments by. Sure, a company may have been increasing its dividend payments for decades, but if it's only making nominal increases each time, then that isn't necessarily translating into much more dividend income for your portfolio. Take Walgreens Boots Alliance as an example. In July 2022, the pharmacy retailer announced a razor-thin 0.5% increase to its dividend. Nonetheless, it was enough to extend its dividend growth streak to 47 consecutive years. On a $10,000 investment, however, that would be the equivalent of just an extra $50 in annual dividend income.  What makes Johnson & Johnson stand out is that the company not only has a long streak and is a top Dividend King, but it has also been aggressively raising its dividend payments. Here's a look at the rate at which the company has been increasing its payouts by over the past decade:  Data source: Company filings. Chart by author. In the last 10 years, the company's dividend payments have risen by 85%, for a compound annual growth rate of 6.4%. That's actually lower than the company's most recent rate hike of 6.6%. That's great news for investors as it means the company has not been slowing down its rate of increases. Again, it reinforces just how impressive Johnson & Johnson's stock is as a dividend investment. And with the company's payout ratio still at a manageable 66%, it wouldn't surprise me if the company were to make another solid rate hike later this month.  Johnson & Johnson's solid pharma, medical device, and consumer health (which the company will be spinning off later this year) segments have helped the company generate strong and consistent results, and that has allowed it to continue raising its dividend without issue. While it has faced multiple legal problems and lawsuits relating to some of its products, the company has maintained a strong profit margin of around 19% in the past five years. JNJ Profit Margin (Annual) data by YCharts. One legal battle it may soon be able to resolve relates to its talc lawsuits. Although it may cost the business $8.9 billion in today's dollars, when spread out over a period of 25 years, it's a manageable amount for the business, given its strong financials. If it's successful in getting the proposed settlement approved, it will make the stock an even safer investment moving forward as it will get rid of a lot of legal uncertainty surrounding the business. If you're a dividend investor, Johnson & Johnson is a stock that you should consider adding to your portfolio. The business is hugely profitable, and despite all the adversity it has faced, it has continued posting strong profits while also raising its dividend at relatively high rates. With the company spinning off its slow-growing consumer health business, that can also allow Johnson & Johnson to focus more on pharmaceuticals and medical devices, which have better growth prospects. All in all, this can be a solid long-term investment to hang on to. David Jagielski has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool recommends Johnson & Johnson.

Learn More Dividends can be a reliable way to generate passive income. However, not all companies have the financial fortitude to maintain their dividends during tough times. That's why investors need to ensure the companies paying them dividends can sustain those payouts over the long haul. One way to measure a dividend's risk is to examine the underlying company's bond rating. Companies with higher bond ratings have a lower risk of reducing their dividends during an economic downturn. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ -0.54%) and Microsoft (MSFT -0.12%) currently have the best credit in the world, meaning Investors can bank on their dividend payments. Johnson & Johnson has one of the healthiest financial profiles in the world. The healthcare giant ended last year with $24 billion of cash and marketable securities against $40 billion of debt. That put its net debt at around $16 billion. It's an easily affordable level for a company that produced $17 billion of free cash flow last year. That fortress-like balance sheet is why Johnson & Johnson has AAA-rated credit, higher than that of the U.S. government.  Johnson & Johnson's robust free cash flow easily covers its dividend, which yields 2.8% these days. The company paid $11.7 billion of dividends last year. That allowed it to generate excess cash, some of which it used to repurchase shares (about $2.5 billion last year).  The company has an exceptional track record of paying dividends. Last year was its 60th straight year of increasing its dividend. That puts Johnson & Johnson in the elite group of Dividend Kings, companies with 50 or more years of dividend growth.  The healthcare company invests heavily in research and development ($14.6 billion in 2022) to drive future growth. It also uses its strong balance sheet to make acquisitions as opportunities arise (it bought Abiomed for $16.6 billion in cash last year). The company's growth-related investments should expand its cash flow, enabling Johnson & Johnson to continue increasing its rock-solid dividend. That makes Johnson & Johnson stock a great investment for those seeking an ultra-low-risk dividend.  Microsoft sits alongside Johnson & Johnson as the only two companies with better credit than the U.S. Government. The tech behemoth backs that top-tier bond rating with an elite balance sheet. It ended last year with nearly $100 billion of cash, equivalents, and short-term investments. Meanwhile, Microsoft only had about $44 billion of long-term debt.  The technology titan also produces prodigious cash flows. Over the last six months, it generated over $34 billion of net cash from operating activities. That was more than three times its dividend outlay during that period ($9.7 billion). That enabled Microsoft to repurchase shares ($11 billion in the last six months) and make new investments and acquisitions ($13.5 billion in that timeframe).  Microsoft is one of the largest dividend payers in the country, distributing about $18 billion to its shareholders each year. Despite that sizable payout, it has a relatively low yield (less than 1%). However, the company has a solid history of growing its dividend. Microsoft increased the payout for the past 13 years, including by 10% late last year.  The tech giant should be able to continue growing its payout in the future. Microsoft is investing heavily to expand, including making several large-scale investments and acquisitions. It's recently extended its partnership with OpenAI (the developer of the popular ChatGTP AI program) by making a multiyear, multibillion investment into the company to accelerate its innovation. Microsoft is also working to acquire videogame maker Activision Blizzard (ATVI -0.05%) for $68.7 billion in cash to expand its Xbox platform. Those growth drivers make Microsoft stock a potentially rewarding investment for those seeking a supremely sustainable and growing dividend.  Microsoft and Johnson & Johnson offer the lowest-risk dividends around. The companies have fortress-like balance sheets and generate substantial cash flows, putting their payouts on an extremely firm foundation. They're ideal dividend stocks for even the most risk-wary investor.   Matthew DiLallo has positions in Johnson & Johnson.

Learn More Healthcare giant Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ -0.54%) talcum powder litigation has hung over the company like a cloud for years. Could the storm soon pass? J&J recently announced it would settle with tens of thousands of plaintiffs in an agreement worth $8.9 billion. The settlement isn't final, and some investors may avoid the stock altogether because of the harm the company is alleged to have caused. Still, even if the total costs change when all is said and done, the announcement at least gives investors a hard number to digest and move forward with. Issues of morality aside, there's good and bad news about Johnson & Johnson's future. Here's what you should know before buying or selling. The lawsuit against Johnson & Johnson is very serious. The company's talcum powder allegedly hurt people, and the size of the settlement underlines the severe nature of the litigation. Making matters worse is that Johnson & Johnson is already paying $5 billion over nine years for its role in the opioid epidemic. The impact on J&J's reputation will only be known over time, but the company will survive the financial impact of these lawsuits. As with the opioid settlement, the talcum settlement would be paid over time, 25 years in this case. Johnson & Johnson has $23.5 billion in cash on hand -- plenty to pay its obligations:  JNJ Cash and Short Term Investments (Quarterly) data by YCharts. The company's dividend, which has grown for 60 years, doesn't seem at risk of a cut or freeze. The cash dividend payout ratio is 68%, a manageable expense for a profitable company like this. If you've owned the stock or wish to because of its slow and steady (but reliable) nature, it doesn't look like anything changes here. Instead of focusing on the litigation alone, zoom out and look at Johnson & Johnson's big picture. The company's been a multidecade winner, but it's grown large enough recently that growth is becoming increasingly challenging. You can see below that revenue growth has dropped in recent quarters, well below the company's long-term average. Additionally, analysts believe Johnson & Johnson's earnings per share (EPS) will grow at around 5% annually over the coming years.  JNJ Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) data by YCharts That earnings growth isn't going to get anyone excited. And the current dividend yield of 2.7% falls short of most Treasury bonds, which don't have a risk of capital losses as long as you hold until maturity. A consistent Johnson & Johnson would probably deliver on expectations -- but modest growth could mean the stock consistently underperforms the market, barring a spark the company doesn't have right now. Solid returns would be much easier if shares traded at a bargain-basement valuation, leaving room for price gains. Johnson & Johnson trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of nearly 16, a notch below the S&P 500's P/E of 18. It's hard to justify a high valuation when your growth outlook is so light, so while Johnson & Johnson isn't eye-poppingly expensive, it's also not a must-have. Investors buying today could see total returns of around 7% to 8% (earnings growth plus dividend) without any increase in valuation, which may be OK for risk-averse investors. However, there are still better opportunities out there. It's best to concentrate on your best ideas when you put money to work in the market. Johnson & Johnson is a legendary dividend stock and perhaps will become more attractive in the future. But for now, the stock is more something to shrug about than something to get excited about. Justin Pope has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool recommends Johnson & Johnson.

Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn More In 1995, global conglomerate General Electric became the world's first $100 billion company. The industrial giant was producing everything from light bulbs to aircraft engines, and it marked yet another evolution of the U.S. economy -- just 94 years earlier, in 1901, the largest company was United States Steel with a value of $1 billion. That economic progress has never stopped (and likely never will). Technology now rules the day, and in 2018, consumer electronics giant Apple became the first corporation to amass a $1 trillion market capitalization.  It has since been joined by other tech giants like Microsoft, Amazon, and Google parent Alphabet. But the $1 trillion club will only grow larger over time, so which companies might be next to join? I'll share two candidates, and both could deliver juicy returns for investors if they do reach a $1 trillion market capitalization.  Meta Platforms (META -0.08%) might be the only company in the world that can say it serves 3.7 billion people. That's how many users engage with its social media platforms Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp each month. Meta is no stranger to the $1 trillion club, having spent a brief period there in 2021.  It's no longer there because its stock has declined by 42% from its all-time high, which values the company at $571 billion today. Meta's enormous investment in developing the metaverse is one of the reasons its stock has performed so poorly, but ironically, it could form the basis for the company achieving a $1 trillion market value again in the future. Investors grew frustrated over the last two years at Meta's losses in its Reality Labs segment, which is responsible for developing both hardware and software for virtual worlds. It burned $23.9 billion in 2021 and 2022 combined, while a difficult economic environment was also sapping advertising money away from its family of social media apps. A combination of those factors led to stalled revenue growth and declining net income (profit) throughout last year especially. But Meta recently committed to a more disciplined approach to spending, which included a plan to lay off more than 21,000 employees starting in November 2022. CEO Mark Zuckerberg calls this a "year of efficiency" for the company as he predicts the economic environment will continue to be challenging. But the long term is where Meta could create the most value. According to a study conducted by Statista -- which was then cited by the World Economic Forum -- the metaverse could attract 700 million people by 2030, creating a financial opportunity worth as much as $4.4 trillion. Zuckerberg is even more optimistic, predicting 1 billion users will crawl his company's virtual worlds. Since nearly half the planet engages with Meta's existing apps, it isn't difficult to imagine a sizable portion transitioning to its metaverse. In the short term, Meta is doing a great job keeping users engaged across its platforms with new features like Reels, and with the power of artificial intelligence to curate content. Investors have sent Meta stock surging 76% so far in 2023, and if it can book a further 71% gain from here, it will officially be back in the $1 trillion club. Perhaps no company is on a clearer trajectory to a $1 trillion valuation than Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 0.02%) (BRK.B 0.16%). It's the investment house run by the Oracle of Omaha himself, Warren Buffett.  Berkshire holds a portfolio of stocks, Treasuries, and cash worth about $345 billion, and it's structured to represent a cross-section of the U.S. economy. In that stock portfolio, you'll find Coca-Cola, which Berkshire has held since 1988, and Apple, which now represents 44% of the value of the firm's entire holdings. Additionally, it holds stock in an assortment of banks, oil companies, and a few additional technology companies.  Buffett has instilled an ultra-long-term mentality into the firm, meaning it typically invests in stocks it intends to hold for decades, if not forever. It's the best way to benefit from the effects of compounding, particularly since many of Berkshire's holdings pay a juicy dividend. The strategy served the firm very well, as it's currently valued at $714 billion. Since 1965, Berkshire's Class A stock has grown in value at a compound annual rate of 19.8%, which crushes the 9.9% annual return of the benchmark S&P 500 index. In absolute terms, it means $1,000 invested in Berkshire stock in 1965 would've been worth $39.8 million at the end of 2022! A $1,000 investment in the S&P 500 at the same time would've been worth just $247,080.  Its performance has been so strong that the firm has become the most active investor in its own stock, regularly executing buybacks that return money to shareholders by way of a reduced share count, and therefore, a higher share price.  If the pace of Berkshire's annual stock returns continues, the $707 billion company will be sitting alongside Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet in the $1 trillion club within the next two years. But even if it underperforms, getting there is almost a foregone conclusion in the long run.  John Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors. Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors. Randi Zuckerberg, a former director of market development and spokeswoman for Facebook and sister to Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

TSLA (2023-04-17 22:03:14): Sign up for MarketBeat All Access to gain access to MarketBeat's full suite of research tools:  Mobileye Global Inc. (NASDAQ: MBLY) was among the largest IPOs of 2022, admittedly a weak year for public-company launches, as markets declined and tech, in particular, got slammed. The stock has shown strong price appreciation, as well as earnings and revenue growth. It beat expectations on both the top and bottom lines in the past two quarters, as a look at MarketBeat earnings data shows.  The maker of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving solutions went public for the second time in October 2022, after it was spun out of Intel Corp. (NASDAQ: INTC).  Mobileye was already listed on the NYSE before Intel drove away with the entire company in 2027, for a price of $15.3 billion. In October, the stock went public again at $21 a share, less than Intel had hoped to fetch.  But those fortunes have turned around, as the tech sector, as well as the broader market, staged a rally at the beginning of this year. Intel remains the majority shareholder of Mobileye and has participated in the post-IPO rally. Mobileye’s price has doubled since its IPO.  Mobileye leads in the area of computer vision, which allows computers to interpret visual information. According to the company, “The enhanced capabilities … afford greater awareness of traffic signals, potential hazards, road conditions, other road users, and more.” Mobileye says those capabilities translate to greater safety, as well as comfort. This information can assist drivers in various ways, such as alerting them to potential collisions, helping them stay in their lane, and providing guidance while parking.  Mobileye’s capabilities are centered around the company’s EyeQ system-on-chip for automotive applications. Customers include Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA), Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F), and Nio Inc. (NYSE: NIO), among others.  The EyeQ chips are manufactured by STMicroelectronics NV (NYSE: STM), which co-designed the chips with Mobileye. Supply-chain bottlenecks due to Covid-related shutdowns at STMicro’s Chinese factories were responsible for hampering growth at Mobileye in 2022. Nonetheless, revenue grew by nearly 35% in 2022.  This year, the company expects to book sales of $2.25 billion, the midpoint of its guidance.  Operating profit should be $580 million to $630 million. The company is forecasting an operating loss this year, but that’s not something to panic about. The company is in a fast-growing, capital-intensive industry. It’s not unusual to see newly public techs favor growth over profitability. The company expects healthy levels of free cash flow, which is a very positive sign.  In 2024, analysts see Mobileye earning $0.84 a share.  The company reports its first quarter on April 27, with Wall Street eyeing earnings of  $0.13 a share on revenue of $457.64 million. That would be a decrease on the bottom line, but an increase on the top line.  Mobileye is clearly rolling in growth-stock territory, with a price-to-earnings ratio of 57. Although it has its own unique product offerings, combining sensors, cameras, and semiconductors, the company is categorized as a fabless chip maker.  As a group, these stocks are outperforming the broad market, with other top price and earnings performers including Allegro MicroSystems Inc. (NASDAQ: ALGM), Lattice Semiconductor Corp. (NASDAQ: LSCC), Rambus Inc. (NASDAQ: RMBS), Impinj Inc. (NASDAQ: PI), Monolithic Power Systems Inc. (NASDAQ: MPWR) and S&P 500 leader Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA).  Mobileye has been consolidating since mid-February, below a high of $48.11. It’s currently holding just above its 50-day moving average. Upside trading volume has been higher than downside. The Mobileye chart shows some fairly wide intraday and intra-week price swings, which are most noticeable using a bar or candlestick view, rather than a line chart.  Because the stock has a short trading history, it doesn’t yet have a beta, to gauge its volatility versus the broader market.  MarketBeat data show analysts have a consensus rating of “moderate buy,” with a price target of $43.65, representing a 4.19% upside. The current buy point is above the February high of $48.11; a price target below that point isn’t something to be concerned about, as some analysts are slow to update their targets, and may be waiting for the company’s first-quarter report to make any changes.  Before you consider Mobileye Global, you'll want to hear this.

Learn More Shares of healthcare-behemoth Johnson & Johnson (JNJ -0.54%) were down by 2.46% on heavy volume as of 2:23 p.m. ET Tuesday afternoon. The company's shares are slumping today despite its release of better-than-expected 2023 first-quarter earnings ahead of the opening bell.   Specifically, J&J's Q1 non-GAAP earnings exceeded Wall Street's consensus figure by a healthy 7.2%. What's more, the healthcare-titan's top line beat expectations by a handsome 4.6%, fueled by strong sales of the multiple myeloma biologic Darzalex, the anti-inflammatory medicine Stelara, and its COVID-19 vaccine.  Why are investors hitting the exits today? Unfortunately, J&J's management also admitted today that its high-dollar talcum-powder litigation may not be over quite yet. Earlier this month, J&J's stock perked up in response to a proposed $8.9 billion settlement with tens of thousands of litigants over the matter. As a part of this proposed settlment, the healthcare company booked a $6.9 billion charge in the first quarter, resulting in a net loss of $68 million for the three-month period. Nonetheless, J&J's Chief Financial Officer Joseph Wolk said in today's accompanying conference call that a small number of plaintiff attorneys won't give their claimants the right to vote on the matter. This development doesn't mean that J&J's proposed settlement won't ultimately go through, but it does add another unwanted (by investors) wrinkle to the case.  Is J&J's stock a buy on this weakness? The upcoming spinoff of its consumer healthcare unit ought to unlock tremendous value for shareholders, thanks to the stellar growth potential of the company's pharmaceutical and medtech businesses.

JPM (2023-04-18 22:08:37): Sign up for MarketBeat All Access to gain access to MarketBeat's full suite of research tools:  A new upgrade from JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) suggests Ollies Bargain Outlet Holdings, Inc (NASDAQ: OLLI) has value. They upgraded the stock from Underweight to Neutral, which is not an inspiring move but 1 that helps lift the ceiling for the market. An increase in confidence was cited, driven by an expectation the company can sustain growth, improving deal flow, margin recovery and greater visibility. The critical news is that the price target was increased to $66 from $55, opening the door to upward price movement. JPM’s $66 is $4 above the Marketbeat.com consensus, leading the market higher.  The consensus target assumes the stock is fairly valued at current levels, but the trend in sentiment is more important. The price target is trending higher compared to last year, last quarter and last month and is expected to trend higher in the 2nd half. The price target is increasing because the company is investing in growth and growing despite America's economic headwinds. Results have been mixed over the past year, with mild top-line under-performance offset by accelerating growth.  Ollie’s is expected to post a significant decline in sequential results due to seasonal factors. The salient point is that the Marketbeat.com consensus of $449 in first-quarter revenue is up 10.5% compared to last year and is accelerating from 9.7% in Q4. Momentum is expected to carry through the end of the year, but growth may slow to lower high-single-digit levels. The opportunity is that forward estimates have been slow to change due to uncertainty in the broad economy, but that may begin to change now. An increase in the growth outlook, specifically the earnings outlook, will improve the value relative to peers like The TJX Companies (NYSE: TJX), which also pay dividends.  The growth outlook is supported by increased store count and comps. The company reported 5 new stores in Q4 2022, bringing the YOY to 8.8%. That alone is enough to sustain growth near the Q1 pace, not counting improving comps. Comps are also on the rise and are expected to run from 1% to 2% in 2023, but the company has risks. Citigroup (NYSE: C) issued a downgrade a few weeks before JPMorgan’s upgrade, which essentially offsets it. In their view, the company’s recent margin miss, scalability, loyalty club weakness and lack of visibility are cause for concern. Citigroup downgraded from Neutral to Sell with a price target of $49, but it is the only negative movement this year.  Weaker-than-expected retail sales figures are also a cause for concern, but Ollies and its off-price brethren are better suited for these times. Discounting and inventory-clearing actions at major retailers should give Ollie purchasing power regarding selection and price.  Ollie’s Bargain Outlets doesn’t pay a dividend, but the company buys back shares which is almost as good. Repurchases totaled $41.8 million in 2022, worth about 1.1% of the market cap. Repurchases are expected to continue in 2023 and may help the stock to reverse course. As it is, the stock price has bottomed but is trending sideways within a range. The market may drift lower within the range before the next earnings report, but support is expected in the $50 to $55 range.   Before you consider Ollie's Bargain Outlet, you'll want to hear this.

Learn More Johnson & Johnson (JNJ -0.54%) has increased earnings over time -- delivering both share price performance and dividend growth to investors. The company continues to grow through pipeline development and acquisitions. And these efforts are bearing fruit. For instance, regulators approved Tecvayli for multiple myeloma last fall. And J&J bought heart-pump expert Abiomed a few months ago. These moves should keep growth going. But an upcoming transition may eventually give J&J an enormous boost. Should you buy J&J shares before that happens? Let's find out. So first, let's talk about the transition. J&J has long been known for its three businesses: consumer health, pharmaceuticals, and medtech. In fact, it's fair to say most people probably think of J&J as a consumer health player more than anything. That's because consumer health sells popular products most of us use, like Tylenol, Band-Aid bandages, and many well-known skincare brands. Now, J&J is preparing to spin off consumer health into a separate business, to be called Kenvue, later in the year. You might ask: Why would J&J spin off the business we all know it for? There's actually a very good answer. Consumer health generally hasn't grown as fast as the company's other businesses. For example, last year, on an adjusted operational basis, its sales rose less than 4%. That's compared to increases of more than 6% each for pharmaceuticals and medtech. And in the previous year, these two units posted double-digit sales increases while consumer health's gain again remained below 4%. Consumer health also makes up a much smaller share of revenue than the other units. Pharmaceuticals revenue comprised 54% of the $24.7 billion in first-quarter worldwide revenue, Medtech represented 30% of overall revenue, and consumer health represented only 15%. All of this means that with consumer health as a separate entity, J&J will report revenue from the two stronger businesses -- and direct its resources to growing them. That should translate into stronger growth for the company moving forward. Should you buy J&J before this transition? Well, the move itself may not be a huge catalyst. J&J has been planning this for a while. So completion of the spinoff probably won't result in a major share price increase. But I still think getting in on the shares now is a good idea. And here's why. As mentioned above, the operation will help J&J report stronger growth over time. And that should help lift the shares -- not all at once in a day or two but gradually. Today, you can pick up shares of J&J for 15 times forward earnings estimates. That looks very reasonable for a company with a long record of earnings growth -- and solid prospects. For example, J&J aims to increase pharmaceutical sales to $60 billion in 2025, up from $52 billion last year. Meanwhile, if you buy the shares now, you can benefit from J&J's dividend. The company has made lifting its dividend a priority. It's among the elite list of Dividend Kings, meaning they've increased their dividends for at least the past 50 years. So while you wait for J&J shares to deliver, you can generate passive income thanks to its move to focus on its highest-growth businesses. There will likely be plenty of opportunities to buy J&J down the road, of course. As I mentioned, this stock won't take off overnight. But at today's reasonable price and with the idea of benefiting from dividends, right now seems like the perfect time to add this stock to your portfolio.

Learn More We all love watching our favorite stocks rise -- and seeing our portfolios follow along. But whether that happens or not during a given period, we still can make money from our investments. In fact, we can generate cash by doing nothing at all. Sound like a dream? Well it's actually a reality if you hold stocks that pay dividends. One of those stocks is healthcare giant Johnson & Johnson (JNJ -0.54%). In fact, J&J is part of a group of companies known as Dividend Kings that have raised their dividends for at least the past 50 years. And this week, J&J made an announcement that any dividend investor would love. J&J, while reporting earnings, said that dividend payments remain one of the company's priorities -- and lifted its dividend by 5.3%. This is the company's 61st year of annual dividend increases. So, as we can see, it's well into Dividend King territory. This long-term trend is important because it shows J&J's commitment to sharing the wealth with investors. When a company is this engaged in dividend increases, it's likely to continue along that path. J&J's move brings the company's annual dividend to $4.76 per share, for a current dividend yield of 2.9%. This is well above the pharmaceutical industry's average yield (as of January) of 2.15%, according to data from the NYU Stern business school. J&J's cash dividend payout ratio shows it paid out about 67% of its free cash flow in dividends over the past year. And J&J's massive level of free cash flow indicates the company has what it takes to continue raising dividends:  JNJ Cash Dividend Payout Ratio (Annual) data by YCharts. All of this means that J&J continues to be a stock that dividend investors should favor. In the first quarter, J&J paid out $2.9 billion in dividends. But J&J has a second way of rewarding shareholders -- it also prioritizes share buybacks. In the most recent quarter, it completed a $5 billion share repurchase plan. This is positive for multiple reasons: It shows that the company is confident in its future. The move of retiring some shares from the market can boost the stock price. And buybacks also lift earnings per share. By now, J&J probably sounds like a terrific dividend stock, and it is. But the story gets even better; you won't want to buy the stock only for dividends and buybacks. The company also has a solid earnings track record. J&J even raised its guidance for the full year 2023 after a "strong start to the year." It now forecasts an increase in operational sales growth in the range of 5.5% to 6.5%. That's up from an earlier estimate of 4.5% to 5.5%. And growth may get a lift later on this year when J&J spins off its smallest business -- consumer health -- to focus on pharmaceuticals and medtech. Pharmaceuticals and medtech contribute the most to the company's revenue. At the same time, J&J makes investing in research and development a focus too; the company currently has more than 100 candidates in the pipeline. And J&J invested $3.6 billion in R&D in the quarter, up by nearly 3% from the year-earlier period. So what does all of this mean for you? Johnson & Johnson may not be a high-growth stock like a young biotech player. But the big pharma company has delivered increasing earnings over time -- and is taking steps today to ensure that that continues. At the same time, J&J pays you just for owning shares of the company, and has a solid track record of lifting those payments. All of that sounds like a great deal for any long-term investor.
